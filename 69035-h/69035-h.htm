<p class="ph2">THE PUBLIC SQUARE</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">I<br />

<small>54 HARROW STREET</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &#160;GIRL of nineteen had just arrived in New
York, with one fat bag. She turned into the
curving silence of Harrow Street, which is
only three minutes’ walk from Washington Square,
but some trick to find. Several times she changed
her bag from one hand to the other, sometimes putting
it down and stepping around it, until she came to a
door with a room-to-rent sign. This house was painted
fresh green, the only thing that distinguished it from
all the other houses of the block, except the number,
which was Fifty-four.</p>

<p>“Here goes me!” she said, starting up the stone
steps.</p>

<p>She rang. The door before her didn’t open, but
the basement door below did. A woman’s voice called,
“Yes?” in rising inflection.</p>

<p>The girl trailed her bag down to the walk and around
the railing to the lower entrance where a dark-faced
woman stood, regarding her with almost concerned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
attention—dark eyes that saw too much, the girl decided.
The face was un-American, but its foreign
suggestion was vague. It might even have been East
Indian. If her skin was natively white, it had certainly
known the darkening of much sunlight. As the girl
drew near she sensed a curious freshness from the
woman; something hard to name, having to do with
the garments as well as the shadowy olive skin.</p>

<p>“I want to rent a room—a small back room. I saw
your sign on the door.”</p>

<p>“I have a room, but it hasn’t much air,” the woman
said.</p>

<p>“I don’t need much air——”</p>

<p>“Come and we’ll look. It is on the upper floor,
but it is not quite back. Leave your bag here in the
hall.”</p>

<p>It was eleven in the morning, but the smell of coffee
was in the dark basement corridor, and laughing voices
were heard behind the shut door to the right. A man’s
voice said in a stimulated tone:</p>

<p>“Believe me, and I’ve been around, Miss Claes is
the deepest-dyed sport I’ve ever met. You could drag
her the length of Harrow Street and she’d come up
fresh from the laundry——”</p>

<p>“That reminds me, I’m going to start a laundry,”
a woman’s voice announced.</p>

<p>“I’m going to start something myself——” came
another voice.</p>

<p>The girl, following through the corridor, heard a
little breathless sort of chuckle from the woman ahead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
of her on the dark stairs. The place smelled like a
shut room when it rains—a cigaretty admixture.</p>

<p>They climbed. The next hall was spooky with gaslight;
the next was gay with frying sausages. They
climbed. The next was the one, and it smelled of
paint—the same green paint as on the outside of the
house—on one of the doors and doorframes, but the
wood was plainly charred under the paint.</p>

<p>“We had a fire, but we put it out with wash water
before the engines got here, soapy water.”</p>

<p>The girl had a picture of threshing soap about in
pails of water before applying it to the flames.</p>

<p>“This is the one,” the woman said, unlocking the
next to last room from the back on the left. “All the
rest are filled just now. Most of my lodgers never
leave, only as they strike it rich——”</p>

<p>“Do they often strike it rich?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, dear. New York is quite the most magic
place in America—something for every one who comes,
if he only stays on.”</p>

<p>They had crowded into the little room.</p>

<p>“This is fine,” the girl said. “This is what I want.
It’s just as I saw it.”</p>

<p>“You get your water in the hall below,” the woman
explained. “There is no gas plate, so you will have
to bring your coffeepot down to my stove in the basement.
The walls are ugly, but I’ll see that the cot is
clean for you. If the wall of the next house across
the area were only painted white, you would get more
light.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>The wall spoken of was less than three feet from
the window sill.</p>

<p>“What is the price?” the girl asked, with a cough
before and after.</p>

<p>“Twelve dollars a month.”</p>

<p>“I will pay for a month now,” she said, with a small
part of a big out-breath.</p>

<p>“When did you come to New York?” the woman
asked.</p>

<p>“This morning.”</p>

<p>“First time?”</p>

<p>“Yes. From Los Angeles.”</p>

<p>“And you have had four nights on the train?”</p>

<p>“Six. It was a slow tourist train. I sat up from
Chicago——”</p>

<p>“Have you lived in Los Angeles long?”</p>

<p>“Always—in and around.”</p>

<p>“We don’t dare to think of Los Angeles much. To
a lot of us here in New York, it’s a kind of heaven.
Southern California—the sea and the mountains and
the ten months of sunlight and the cool morning fogs
and the ripe figs——”</p>

<p>“I’ve wanted New York like that,” the girl said.
“I’ve wanted New York so badly that I was afraid
on the train that it wouldn’t stay until I got here——”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to come,” the landlady said. “New
York would wait for you. Oh, yes, New York waits
for your kind. What are you going to do here?”</p>

<p>“Write.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>The woman sat down on the edge of the cot. Her
interest did not seem an affectation. Her figure was
thin but lithe. One wouldn’t know in these shadows
if she were nearer twenty-five or thirty-five. She
seemed altogether without haste, smiling easily, but
slow to laugh aloud. Her eyes looked startlingly
knowing as she lit a cigarette—not natural somehow.
At the same time in the matchlight her face had looked
tired and weathered. Her way of speaking was like
an English person, or one educated in England.</p>

<p>“Do you mean stories?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, a book, a long story—set in eighteenth-century
France.”</p>

<p>“But you seem so young.”</p>

<p>“I have written for a long time—always written.”</p>

<p>“How old are you, please?”</p>

<p>“Nineteen—but I have lived in a writing house
always.”</p>

<p>“Where is your house? I have been to Los Angeles.”</p>

<p>“Back in a canyon near Santa Monica and my father
is there now—in his slippers. He teaches every one
how to write——” There was something baleful in
the girl’s blue eyes, or perhaps it was exhaustion, as
she smiled.</p>

<p>“Does he write stories?”</p>

<p>“No, metaphysics, but he knows everything——”</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Musser—Pidge Musser. Not Pidge, really. Pandora<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
is my name, but every one calls me Pidge. My
father started it.”</p>

<p>“Is his name Adolph Musser?”</p>

<p>In the dimness, the girl’s face looked like a blur of
white; a little stretched, too, it appeared just now.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s his name,” she said in a hopeless tone.
“So you know him, too?”</p>

<p>“I heard him lecture once.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you ‘fell for’ him? They all do.”</p>

<p>The woman’s black eyes twinkled. “The lecture was
on cosmic consciousness,” she said. “I remember distinctly
that Mr. Musser outlined four paths of approach.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the mystical, the occult, the mathematical, and
the artistic. Did he talk in bare feet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and an Eastern robe.”</p>

<p>“That was a camel driver’s robe,” said the girl.
“Oh, I didn’t think I’d hear of him here.”</p>

<p>“You won’t. May I call you Pidge?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what you like. My father names everything.”</p>

<p>“It sounds better than Pandora—at least, to me....
I must go down now. A little breakfast party is waiting
there. Take off your things. I’ll come back soon.
I am Miss Claes and I want to come back already.”</p>

<p>Pidge Musser sat almost in the center of her room,
but not quite. At least, she sat in the center of the
stiff little cot. She could touch two of the walls. The
third was across the narrow aisle from the cot. The
fourth was the windowed one, which looked as if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
were about to be bricked up entirely. That was quite
a distance.</p>

<p>Her room. She was alone. She looked at the door,
arose, brought in the key and turned it from the inside.
Alone, and this was New York. She could live a month
anyway, and write and write on <i>The Lance of the
Rivernais</i>. She could be herself and not be told how
to live and love and write and bathe and breathe, and
change her polarity and promote her spirit and govern
her temper and appetites, by a man who was governed
by anything but himself.</p>

<p>New York. She had hardly dared to look at it on
the way from the train to Washington Square, where
the street car had put her down. She had come to
Washington Square because one of the boys who
studied with her father had said it was the best place
to live in all the big town—the cheapest and friendliest
and quietest.... It appeared all true, but Miss
Claes wasn’t like a rooming-house landlady; quite
different, in fact, and astonishing.</p>

<p>“I could hear her talk about New York, forever,”
Pidge said half aloud, and this was a remark of considerable
force from one who had known the maiming
of many words.</p>

<p>Presently she would go out and look at New York
again; walk about a bit, keeping a mental string tied
to this green house. Besides she had to rent a typewriter,
but there was no rush. It was delicious sitting
here alone in the gloom of midday, making the place
her own, locked in—a chance at last to take a look at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
herself and see what she was made of and think of
what she was here for.</p>

<p>There was a mirror. It wasn’t cracked, according
to tradition, but its surface had frozen over in a high
wind. Everything waved, eternally waved. It gave
the sense of air in the room, and made one look mended.
Pidge hoped she would never shed tears in that mirror.
Once she had caught herself weeping, and she looked
so abysmal that she was almost frightened out of the
habit. With these waves added—— Pidge took off
her hat and flipped it over on the cot. Her head didn’t
look natural, but that wasn’t all the mirror’s fault. One
of the things she had wanted to do for months was to
make her hair a shade redder than it was. Of course,
she hadn’t dared at home, and she couldn’t manage it
on the train, but there had been six hours to wait in
Chicago and a small hotel room that frightened her yet.
She had emerged from that room a different shade, so
Chicago meant henna and rain and a frightful hotel.
It would always be so. She had been against landing
in New York one color and then changing. She had
wanted to start life new in New York and keep it
straight, an absolutely new page, a new book.</p>

<p>Her reddened hair waved. It made her face look
whiter, and brought out a red tint to her wool dress that
had been brown as apple-butter before.</p>

<p>Everything about her was tired. If she took off her
new shoes she was afraid she would never get them on
again to-day, and she had to think of renting that
typewriter. A little later, she sat up straight, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
through the wall from the next room back came the
buzz of a machine. She listened with a thrill. It
stopped and went on—unequal stops and buzzes of
rapid typing for several minutes; then a long sustained
buzz, until a sheet was changed. No commercial typewriting.
That was “creative” stuff, as her father would
say—a word she had vowed never to use. At least,
some one in there was doing a letter.</p>

<p>All this was before noon on an October day in the
good year of 1913, before anything ever happened to
anybody.</p>

<small>THE COLORED MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Once there was an old sculptor who had apprentices.
Townsfolk were invited on a certain day to look at the
work of the young men. One of the apprentices was
greatly worried by the faulty light of the shop in
which his exhibit was placed. He complained about
it to his master, who is said to have answered in these
terms: “Never mind, son, about the light here. It is
the light of the public square that tells the story.”</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap3">RICHARD COBDEN was twenty-one in 1910,
and fresh from his university, when he took
his first job as reader in the editorial office of
<i>The Public Square</i>, a weekly magazine of opinion and
protest and qualified patriotism. This was the publication
of old John Higgins, at one time one of the
highest-priced editorial writers in New York; but
Higgins’ views had become more and more strenuous,
instead of mollifying with the years, the end of which
is to publish for one’s self or subside. Even in <i>The
Public Square</i> he found himself under a pull. He
wanted a living out of his magazine, but did not expect
to make money. He occasionally drank himself ill for
a day or two. One of his aspirations was to publish a
distinguished short story in each issue, the shorter the
better.</p>

<p>“But there aren’t fifty a year,” he frequently said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
“There aren’t ten, but we get two or three of them.”</p>

<p>Richard Cobden came of a well-established New
York family of merchants and manufacturers. There
was no traceable connection, so far as the family knew,
with the English Cobdens, of whom there had been
a brave Richard of free trade and free speech. Dicky’s
great-grandfather was the Richard Cobden who first
made the Cobden trowel, hand-forged in a little shop
up Yonkers way, and made it so well that stone
masons used to drive from far in back country to his
shop. The Cobdens had made and dealt in hardware
ever since, but the trowel was the Cobden <i>cachet</i>.</p>

<p>Dicky was now twenty-four. His eyes were strong
and so were his enthusiasms. These strengths stood
him in good stead against the vast masses of evil typing
and the revelations of human frailty contained in a
myriad manuscript attempts. There was a mere screen
between his desk and the desk of John Higgins. One
winter afternoon, Dicky was interrupted by talk between
the chief and the office boy:</p>

<p>“That colored guy in the reception room won’t go
’way,” the boy said.</p>

<p>“What guy is that?” Higgins asked.</p>

<p>“The one I told you about two hours ago when you
came back from lunch.”</p>

<p>“What does he want?”</p>

<p>“He’s got a story. He says he’ll wait for you.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“It ain’t a natcherl name. He says the name doesn’t
matter—that you don’t know him, anyway.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“Tell him to leave his manuscript.”</p>

<p>“He won’t. Every little while he pulls up his sock.”</p>

<p>“Let him sit a bit longer. It’s a regular park bench
out there, anyway——”</p>

<p>It was the dragging sock that attracted Dicky Cobden—a
bit of mindless art on the part of the office
boy that somehow aroused the young man by the
dreary manuscript pile. Dicky’s world was now full
of people who thought they had the story of the age;
people who wanted to see the publisher himself; people
afraid to trust their manuscripts to the mails; a world
of such, coming up through great tribulation, but only
here and there a dragging sock. He took a chance now
and volunteered to Higgins to clear that bit of seat
space in the reception room, if possible.</p>

<p>A dark-faced young man arose to meet him outside.
Tired—that was the word that bored into Cobden’s
mind with new meaning. There was something potent
in the weariness of the black eyes, a deadly sort of
patience that rarely goes with brilliance. Dicky was
slightly above medium height. The other’s eyes were
level with his own. The hanging sock was not in evidence,
but Dicky felt that the stranger didn’t dare to
move fast, for fear his clothes would break.</p>

<p>“Yet he feels clean,” he thought, “yet he feels clean.”
This was important enough to repeat.</p>

<p>“I have a story——”</p>

<p>“Your name?”</p>

<p>“It is Naidu—but not known.”</p>

<p>“Are you from India?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why not let us have your story to read?”</p>

<p>“It must be read now.”</p>

<p>“This sort of thing isn’t done while one waits, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid this one will have to be done so.”</p>

<p>“Why, even if it’s promising,” Dicky declared severely,
“it would have to be read several times.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait.”</p>

<p>“But we have hundreds——”</p>

<p>“I know—may I not see the chief editor?”</p>

<p>Mr. Naidu turned slowly back to the bench, as if
to resume his seat.</p>

<p>“You win,” Dicky slowly said. “I’ll take the story
and read it now, though I’m only a deck hand. If it
looks good enough, I’ll try to get Mr. Higgins to
look——”</p>

<p>Five minutes after that, Dicky was deep in South
Africa. Six thousand words in neat but faded typing,
called <i>The Little Man</i>, about a diminutive Hindu person
who appeared to have no other business in life but to
stand up for the under dog. This person would fight
anything, but the British Government was about the size
of a foe he liked best—a cheerful story of most shocking
suffering, which the Little Man took upon himself
for the natives of Natal—no, not the natives, but for
the Hindu laborers who had come to Africa to settle.
A clear, burning patience through the pages; everything
was carried in solution—all one breath, sustained. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
wasn’t writing. It was living. It slid on with a soft
inevitable rhythm, and it took Dicky along.</p>

<p>More than this, he saw in the story—or in the great
stillness which the story brought him—something of
the sort of thing he meant to write some day. Nothing
exactly like this, of course, but the achievement of this
unfettered ease. It made him want to start out at once
to find the Little Man. It made him hear from Africa
something like a personal call. He let himself dream
for a moment. Wouldn’t it be great, his mind-made
picture ran, when he had done a real story of his own—wouldn’t
it be great to deliver it like this (or perhaps
sockless) and make it sell itself? Halfway through,
he arose and dumped the sheets he had read before
Higgins’ spectacles, saying with slow-measured calm:</p>

<p>“She breathes. She’s a leaping trout!”</p>

<p>“Get out,” said Higgins softly.</p>

<p>“That’s only half,” said Cobden.</p>

<p>“Where’s the rest?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it in there—not read yet.”</p>

<p>“And you bring this to me?”</p>

<p>“He’s waiting. This story will finish itself. I know
it will march straight.”</p>

<p>While he read the second half, Dicky heard Higgins
thresh and mutter, and finally call for the rest—old
sore-eyed Higgins, who knew a story when he saw one,
who had read his eyes out on poor stories looking for
the Story of the Age....</p>

<p>Dicky went back to the reception room.</p>

<p>“I’ve read it. Mr. Higgins is reading it now. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
think he’ll want it, Mr. Naidu. If you leave your
address, we’ll mail you an offer to-morrow——”</p>

<p>“I will take two hundred dollars for the story, but
I must have the money to-day.”</p>

<p>Dicky laughed quietly. “I’m afraid the countingroom
won’t appreciate that. Countingroom’s not
adaptable. It’s intricate, in fact; checks signed and
countersigned.... Besides your price is severe for
us—unknown name and all that. Oh, it’s not too
much, only for us, you know.”</p>

<p>All the time he talked, Dicky knew Mr. Naidu would
get his money, and get it to-day. A man with a story
like this could get anything. He could write it on
wood chips and bring the manuscript in a gunny
sack....</p>

<p>“I’ll give him my personal check,” he told Higgins,
a moment later. “The office can reimburse me.”</p>

<p>“I always forget you have a piece of change in
your own name,” Higgins remarked indulgently.
“Don’t ever let it interfere with your work, Dicky.”</p>

<p>“My work to-day is to get that manuscript in our
vault. Later,” he added to himself, “my work is to
write a story as good as that.”</p>

<p>“He might take less than two hundred——” John
Higgins suggested in uncertain tone.</p>

<p>“I can’t bring that up—again,” Dicky said.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t either,” said the editor. “Maybe we
are both crazy with the heat—steam heat. But I’ll
stand by and see that you get your money. You’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
have to go out with him to get cash on your personal
check.”</p>

<p>Dicky and Mr. Naidu were in the street. It was
too late for the bank, but the son of the trowel makers
found a friend of the family with currency. A rainy
dusk in Twenty-third Street near the Avenue, when
he took Mr. Naidu’s hand, having turned over the
money.</p>

<p>“I have your address, I may hunt you up. You won’t
forget <i>The Public Square</i>, when you have another story
as good as this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the Hindu, “nor you, Mr. Cobden.
Good-by.”</p>

<p>Dicky turned to look after him. He reflected that
he hadn’t even learned if Mr. Naidu were hungry. He
wished he had given him his umbrella. He felt a
curious desire to follow; a sense vague, as yet, that his
way, the way of his Big Story, lay after the Oriental,
and not back toward the office.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III<br />

<small>A FISH OMELET</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SNOW had drifted into the outer basement
stairway of the green house, and there was a
thin frosty bar inside the door of the basement
hall. Miss Claes opened the door and looked out
through the iron railings to the street. Snow was six
inches deep and still falling. She took a deep breath
appreciatively, as if she found some faint exquisite
scent in the cold air. Presently she began sweeping at
the doorway, and continued up the stone steps to the
walk. Her arms and throat were bare, and the dark
gray dress that she wore was of wool but the fabric
very thin. Apparently Miss Claes chose to enjoy the
chill of the winter morning. When she returned to
her living room, the fire in the grate had been started
and a small cup of black coffee was on the table. She
sipped thoughtfully and then lit a cigarette, which she
half finished, standing by the fireplace.</p>

<p>The kindling had ignited the soft coal, but not without
having shot out a spray of cinders over the cement
hearth. Miss Claes swept the hearth unhurriedly. A
cabinet of dishes across the room from the fireplace
was full of color now from the light of the coals—vivid
greens and bronzes, pomegranate reds. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
length, she opened the door to the kitchen, where an
Oriental stood by the big range.</p>

<p>“May I serve your breakfast?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Put it on a tray with something for Pidge. I’ll
take it upstairs and perhaps she’ll join me. The child
starves.”</p>

<p>“Not in this house——”</p>

<p>“She’s troublesome to do anything for, Nagar. She
rebels against accepting any favor. I think she must
have been forced to accept many favors from people
outside, when she lived with her father. Was there a
bit of boiled halibut left from last night?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make a little omelet with a few flakes of fish
in it. I’m sure she isn’t getting any money from her
father, but she has kept up her rent in advance. Did
she work all night?”</p>

<p>“Her room was quiet after two, until I came down.
Then I heard her typewriter as I swept the upper
hall.”</p>

<p>“It seems to be a race, Nagar, between the child and
her book—which will finish the other? I love her spirit,
but she isn’t taking care of herself.... Yes, we’ll
put in these asparagus tips.... I think Mr. Musser
believes that the world owes him a living, but finds it
hard to collect, sometimes, with only metaphysics to
offer. And now Pidge has flung herself to the opposite
extreme; talks of earning her living in a factory, when
her book is done. She’s a living protest against talking
and not doing. We must be very good to her, Nagar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Miss Claes brought a little creamy porcelain urn,
and held it for him to fill with coffee from the larger
pot. Nagar held the door open for her into the basement
hall. A moment later on the top floor, she tapped
at the second last door on the left. Pidge sat at her
machine under the gaslight beyond the head of the cot.</p>

<p>“I can’t make their swords play!” she moaned. “All
my swords are stiff as shinny sticks. The trouble is,
I don’t know men, Miss Claes—not red animal men
like they should be in this story. I know pussy men.
I know pious men, salvey and wormy men, monks and
mummies and monsters, but I don’t know honest-to-God
<i>men</i>! Here they are taunting each other as they
stab, and their talk sounds—like Shakespeare! Oh,
dear, you’ve brought me more coffee and eats!”</p>

<p>“I won’t touch your papers, Pidge, but if you take
them off the cot, I’ll put the tray between us. I haven’t
had breakfast.”</p>

<p>Pidge turned the roller of her typemill down so that
the most recent literary revelation might not appear to
a roving eye. Then she crisscrossed different packages
of manuscript, placed the mass face down before the
waving glass, and moved the oil stove aside so she could
pass to her place on the cot.</p>

<p>“You always forget to bring your coffeepot down
to the range, Pidge——”</p>

<p>The girl turned back to her typemachine. “He’s
a jealous old devil when I leave the room,” she said.
“I think the person who rented him before I did addressed
envelopes all day—kept cranking him back and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
forth against time. Now I ride a little ways—then let
him stop and browse. We ramble——”</p>

<p>Pidge stopped. Her eyes looked dry and smarting,
as if tears were on the verge.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Claes,” she went on, “I’m just as crazy
as that—I mean my figures of speech! Cranking him
back and forth, and in the same breath letting him
stop and browse. I wish you wouldn’t bring me this
stuff any more. The coffee’s so good that it hurts—and
the eggs. I always cry when I’m hurt.”</p>

<p>“But, Pidge, think what a privilege it is for me to
climb from the heart of New York to eighteenth-century
France, and not leave the house——”</p>

<p>“But you find a twisted cubist sort of France—part
Dumas, part Mexican Plaza, Los Angeles, and the
rest <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“At least, you’re not carried away with the idea
that it’s perfect.”</p>

<p>Pidge regarded the other’s face closely. She could
see with uncanny clearness in this little dark room
where she had struggled night and day for nearly three
months; but what she saw now, or was looking for,
she hardly knew herself. Her own face was spooky
from sleepless strain.</p>

<p>“I’m eating shamelessly,” she said.</p>

<p>A moment later, she pointed to the rear wall, and
whispered the question:</p>

<p>“Has Nagar stopped writing? I haven’t raced typewriters
with him lately.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t spoken of changing his work. Did you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
hear that New York has touched him with her magic?”
Miss Claes asked.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“He has sold a story—a short story for two hundred
dollars to <i>The Public Square</i>.”</p>

<p>“Nagar—your servant?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t my servant, Pidge. He just lives here and
works with me.”</p>

<p>There was a clicking dryness to the girl’s tongue, as
she asked:</p>

<p>“And now is he going away? You said they always
do when they strike it rich.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Nagar wouldn’t leave for a little story
success. But nobody quite knows Nagar—nobody.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pidge was alone. <i>The Lance of the Rivernais</i> was
pricking at her to get back to work, but she resisted
for a few minutes, thinking of Miss Claes.</p>

<p>“... She may be crazy, but she’s good to look
at,” she muttered. “I believe she can look into me,
too.... I wonder what she is?... She may be
crazy, but she’s kind! And, oh, I’m so tired,” she
yawned a moment later. “I’d like—I’d like to be a
leaf in the park under the snow—still snowing, and
sleep till spring. Only I’d like some roast turkey first.”</p>

<p>The recent breakfast had an extraordinary flavor,
but it was all too dainty for one who had eaten little
or nothing since yesterday morning. Her mind trailed
off to buns she had seen in bakery windows; and
delicatessen stores with opened sausages, big as one’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
head and colored like tapestries, and little brown birds
and deviled eggs, and sliced filets of fish of amazing
tint.</p>

<p>All meats had been anathema in the house of Mr.
Adolph Musser. Pidge had lived in no other house
in all her years, before coming to New York, but since
then, she had shocked her young self through various
experiments among the fleshpots of Greenwich. Not
so various, for the narrowness of her purse was ever
a limp fact, but these few flavory adventures were
exciting and memorable. There was a tap of a finger
nail upon the panel.</p>

<p>“A letter, Miss Musser,” Nagar said.</p>

<p>She looked at the Hindu with different eyes from
ever before. He had sold a story. She wanted to
speak of it, wanted to sit before him and listen—this
anomaly, whose typewriter she had sometimes heard
through the partition, and rarely a low deep hum. She
was prejudiced against Hindus, because her father had
affected such a knowledge of them, but somehow she
had been less lonely in New York because of this one.
He was embodied Detachment and Impersonality....
He had turned away.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Nagar,” she called.</p>

<p>The letter was a typewriter bill.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV<br />

<small>LAMBILL KNOCKS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">INSIDE the moonlit castle gardens, across the
moat into the pictured halls, up the marble staircase,
driving straight and true, Lambill Courtenay,
a man of the people—artist, swordsman, lover virgin-hearted,
rode—no, ran, for once on his sprightly feet,
straight to a sequestered wing of the ancient and noble
castle of the Rivernais, and with his ungloved hand
touched the knocker of its inner sanctuary.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” came the cry like the thin note of
violins.</p>

<p>“I——” swelled the deep orchestral answer of Lambill
Courtenay, Frenchiest of the French.</p>

<p>Then the great oaken door from the forests of Savoie
opened. Lambill crossed the threshold. The white
arms of Madelaine Rivernais opened and the heavens
opened also—for the great maze of life had been
untangled for these two—and Pidge Musser’s book
was done.</p>

<p>Just a book—one of the myriads that you see lying
around, like sloughed snake skins on first or secondhand
bookshelves—but it had been properly wept on and
starved for and toiled over, as only youth in its abandonment
can toil for its own ends. It had almost been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
prayed for, but not quite. Prayer wasn’t easy for
Pidge Musser’s defiant soul.</p>

<p>It was two in the morning. The oil stove smelled
as if it were dying. Of late the wick had hiked up
out of the oil a little earlier each night like a waxing
moon, and Pidge had been forced to shake the oil
around to keep the flame. Miss Claes and Nagar did
so much for her, she was ashamed; and you could get
a red apple for the price of a wick.</p>

<p>Pidge coughed. It was the most astonishing and
cavernous bark. The silence afterward was painful.
She fancied she was keeping <i>him</i> awake—the silent,
dark and courteous Nagar, who did prodigies of work
every day and was always willing to do more, and who
had come into Pidge’s direct limelight since his sale
of a story to <i>The Public Square</i>. Pidge hadn’t known
a cold for years. It actually amazed her, how unclean
it made her feel, and ashamed to have anybody come
near.</p>

<p>“I’m going to watch over you very closely, Pidge—you’ll
have to let me, now that the book is done,”
Miss Claes said in the morning, “because it’s really a
shock to stop work after the way you have carried
on. The drive—suddenly stopping, you know.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how she knows?” Pidge thought to herself
for the thousandth time in regard to the subtle
capacities of Miss Claes.</p>

<p>“I’m tough,” she said aloud.</p>

<p>“That is a true saying, Pidge. On that, everything
hinges. Am I to hear the story?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“It would—it must be read aloud. It’s terrible to
ask, but will you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve wanted to hear it from the beginning. Now
tell me, would you like Nagar to listen, too?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“Just as you like. Only you’re offering it to the
world later——”</p>

<p>“But Nagar <i>knows</i>.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you want, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but——”</p>

<p>“He won’t say a word. Nagar rarely talks, except
to answer questions. But, of course, don’t think of
it, if you’d rather not.”</p>

<p>“What is Nagar?” Pidge asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Just a watcher and listener in America, learning
to see things impersonally.”</p>

<p>Pidge contemplated the idea for a few seconds;
then her eyes hardened. “I’ve heard lots of talk about
the impersonal—oh, talk to the skies about the impersonal
life in Los Angeles—by people who haven’t yet
got a personality!”</p>

<p>Miss Claes bent in low laughter.</p>

<p>“They start in killing out personality before they
get a live one,” Pidge added sullenly.</p>

<p>“They do, my dear, but have you heard any words
about the impersonal life from Nagar?”</p>

<p>“No. That’s the best thing about him—that he
doesn’t explain himself. But I hate mysteries about
Hindus—hate people moving about saying, ‘Shh-sh’—finger
on their lips, trying to astonish you with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
something they can’t tell. I’m so tired of all that!”</p>

<p>“Still you asked me about Nagar, though really there
is nothing to say, except that he is good to have in the
house.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll let him come and hear the reading, if
he’s willing.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Miss Claes. “We will listen in this
room, where the story came to be.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... Nagar sat in a straight chair, in the aisle
between the cot and the wall. Pidge sat by the window
before her machine. Miss Claes lay on the cot with
her head under the light that Pidge read by, and away
they went. There was an hour or more in the early
afternoon when both Miss Claes and her helper could
escape from below, and two hours, at least, after nine
in the evening—this for three days.</p>

<p>Pidge was fagged and ill and frightfully scared.
She would begin hoarsely, and for pages in each reading
her cold in the head was an obstruction hard to
pass; besides, she felt she was boring them horribly
and that all the massed effects of her pages dithered
away into nothing or worse. But a moment came in
each of the six sessions, when the last monster of the
mind’s outer darkness was passed. And then, for
Pidge, at least, knighthood rose resplendent; days became
stately, indeed, and chivalry bloomed again. At
such times the dark gleaming hair of Miss Claes—which
Pidge could have touched with her hand, became
the tresses of Madelaine Rivernais herself, and a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
back to the right in the deep shadows, the face of the
Easterner there took on the magic and glamour of
Lambill’s own. The vineyards of old France stretched
beyond from their balcony; the rivers of France flowed
below. The lance of the Rivernais was won back
heroically and human hearts opened to the drama of
love and life.</p>

<p>But on the last night of the reading, after the self-consciousness
was passed and all was going well, Pidge,
glancing down to Miss Claes’ head under the light, saw
gray for the first time, in the depths of her hair. It
hadn’t been combed with any purpose of hiding. The
outer strands were coal black, the strands beneath had
turned. This discovery had the peculiar effect of
changing everything around in Pidge’s mind in the
moments that followed.</p>

<p>She couldn’t get into the story as before; and in the
very last pages of her reading, a face persistently
crowded in between her mind’s eye and the rapid flow
of the story at its end—a long, humorless complacent
face—the high-browed, self-willed and self-thrilled face
of her father. It was as if he were reading and not
herself; reading with rising expectation, drinking in
the silent praise, as if he had done the writing himself
and loved it well. So effectually was Pidge mastered
by this apparition of her own mind, that the last pages
of the manuscript were spoiled entirely. The light had
gone out of her and she said hastily, as the final page
was turned down:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“I know how kind you are, but please don’t try to
tell me anything to-night. Not a word, please!”</p>

<p>There was something in Nagar’s smile as he turned
and went out that she knew she would remember again.</p>

<p>“I quite understand,” said Miss Claes, when they
were alone. “But say, Pidge, I do want to say this.
To-morrow afternoon, Mr. Richard Cobden, an editor
of <i>The Public Square</i>, is coming here to see Nagar.
He is the one who put through Nagar’s story. We’re
to have tea at four. You’ll come down, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, of course.”</p>

<p>“It might be arranged for Mr. Cobden to look at
your book. Would you like that?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind if I suggest something?”</p>

<p>“Please,” said Pidge.</p>

<p>“Don’t let Mr. Cobden know, just yet, that you are
the one who has written the story. Write a new title-page
without the name of the author.”</p>

<p>“All right, but——”</p>

<p>“It’s because you look like such a child, Pidge. No
one would be able to see all that’s in your story—if
they saw what a child you are!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do as you say. Thank you, but, Miss Claes——”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“To-night under the light, I saw your hair—underneath!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“It made me see everything differently for a minute.
You know I hate cults and everything that apes India<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
and talks about saving the world; everybody talking
about their souls, but doing the same old secret selfish
things—oh, I’ve almost died of talk about all that—but
for a minute, to-night under the lamp, it seemed
that you knew, but had come down to brass tacks—your
feet on the ground—living like the rest of us,
but not ‘falling for’ love or money or fame, as we are.
Are you really through talking about service—just
doing it?”</p>

<p>Miss Claes laughed. “Such a lot of words, Pidge—about
some gray hair.”</p>

<p>Pidge was intensely serious. “Are you English?”
she began again.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I know you’ve been in India. Miss Claes—are
you really farther along than I thought? Are you trying
for that impersonal thing—trying to belong to
everybody—to enter the stream of humanity, as they
call it?”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m trying, Pidge.”</p>

<p>“You and Nagar working together?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you and I are working together, too.”</p>

<p>Pidge was not to be turned aside by generalities.</p>

<p>“You—down here in lower New York—keeping a
rooming house?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—only it’s so big, so unexpected. I’ve
always believed ’way down deep that a real person
wouldn’t be long-haired or barefooted or pious, but
lost in the crowd something like that—quietly efficient,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
moving here and there among people unannounced, only
a few ever dreaming! Oh, it’s too, too big!”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to believe anything, Pidge.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been spoiled for believing anything, by so
much talk!”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to settle things ahead of time,” Miss Claes
repeated laughingly. “Let the days—each day tell its
story. I’m just living out life as you are.... And
now undress and get into bed. I know you’re too tired
to sleep, but I’m going to fix you in and open your
window and put out your light, and sit with you for a
minute, perhaps in the dark. You’re just to rest—a
tired little girl—and not even hear me go away.”</p>

<small>LUNCHEON AT SHARPE’S</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">RICHARD COBDEN and John Higgins were
lunching at Sharpe’s Chop House. It was
one-thirty, and at the height of the day’s business.
The tables were packed close.</p>

<p>“You were telling me about that Asiatic landlady
down in the Village,” Higgins said, lifting his spectacles
to wipe his red-rimmed eyes.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t telling you much,” said Dicky. “She’s
too deep for me—looks to thrive on coffee and cigarettes—eyes
that have seen too much, a lot of laughter
in them, but no hope.... And what would you think
of a basement room, with flowers in winter and a fireplace
with hickory embers, a Byzantine jar in the corner
and a cabinet of porcelain which I haven’t seen the like
of on this side?”</p>

<p>“Go on—don’t mind me,” said John Higgins.</p>

<p>“... Little old Harrow Street,” Dicky mused.
“Harrow Street curves, you know. There is quite
a mass of rooming houses on each side, and number
Fifty-four, with a green front, is Miss Claes’ house.
And our Mr. Naidu works there with his hands; only
they call him Nagar in that house—spelled with an
‘a’ but pronounced ‘nog.’... By the way, he told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
me twice, yesterday, that it isn’t a fiction story we’ve
bought, but a handling of things that actually happened
in Africa—Little Man an actual human being
named Gandhi or something of the sort.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be done. Fiction and life are different,”
said John Higgins.</p>

<p>Dicky resumed: “Some of Miss Claes’ lodgers
happened in for the tea party. No one barred apparently.
I must have seen most of the houseful: couple
of girl-pals; one works in a restaurant to support the
other who is to become a prima donna; a couple of
decayed vaudeville artists looking for a legacy—a regular
houseful, but I don’t believe all of them pay, as they
would have to in other houses.”</p>

<p>“Landlady supports those who can’t?”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I see it. The green front in Harrow
Street took hold of me. I must have stayed over two
hours. Our Mr. Naidu made some coffee to go with
that cabinet of porcelain. Also there was a little girl—from
Los Angeles, I think they said—red head,
brown wool dress and eyes of a blue you see on illumined
vellum out of Italy——”</p>

<p>“Some cerulean,” said John Higgins.</p>

<p>“They weren’t large, particularly,” Dicky went on
at his literary best, “but that extraordinary blue like
the ocean. Ruffled on top, but calm and still in the
depth! Never saw such eyes. They come back to
me now——”</p>

<p>“They do to me, Dicky.”</p>

<p>“You’re not getting all I mean, John. Uptown here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
we think we’re the center of the world, the heart of
New York yanking up toward the Park—but down
there those old rooming houses are filling up with the
boys and girls from all the States west, and the
second growths from the families of European immigrants—filling
up because they are cheap, with the
boys and girls who will do the surgery ten years from
now, and the painting and writing and acting——”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard about all that,” said John Higgins.
“You’ll do a big story yourself one day.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of it, since yesterday. I couldn’t
take their chances. I couldn’t sit down and do a novel
and not know how I was going to eat my way through.
I couldn’t scrub tenement-house floors for the privilege
of writing a book.... Oh, I love books all right.
I rise up and yell when a big short story comes in the
office, or breaks out anywhere. I think I know a real
one, but a man’s got to do a whole lot of appreciating
before he gets to doing. I’m not bred somehow as
those people are. I’m the first of the Cobdens to break
out of trade. They call <i>me</i> a dreamer, my people do—yet
compared to those boys and girls in Harrow
Street, I’m a basket of fish with only a wiggle at the
bottom——”</p>

<p>“Get out,” said John Higgins. “The first thing
you know, you’ll be going down there again.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Dicky. “I’m going down there to
live.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>The younger man nodded seriously. “They’re crazy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
perhaps, but I’m convinced from yesterday of one
thing: One can’t be sane as I am, and ever find the
Big Story, much less write it.”</p>

<p>“Therefore the first thing to do is to go insane.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t like that,” Dicky said gently. “I’ve been
brought up to think I know New York, belong and
breathe in New York. You see, my family has lived
here a hundred years. But yesterday I saw New York
for the first time. She isn’t an old Dutch frump,
as we thought, John. She’s a damsel! She’s a new
moon——”</p>

<p>“Blue eyes?” said John Higgins.</p>

<p>“No, that’s the little girl from Los Angeles. It’s
the landlady, of course, who’s the spirit of the place.
I figured out afterward that it was because she was
there that I liked everybody and had a good time.
Wouldn’t be surprised to hear she was a priestess of
some sort. I asked if she were Hindu, and she said
‘Yes,’ but she talks as if she were out of an English
convent. Of course, most of her lodgers don’t get her.
One old actor, out of a job, leaned across the table to
me yesterday when Miss Claes left the room. He
tapped his forehead, whispering, ‘Lovely, eh, but got
the Ophelias.’”</p>

<p>“Is she young?” John Higgins asked presently.</p>

<p>“Moreover,” Dicky added, lost in thought, “I believe
Miss Claes knows that they think her cracked
and doesn’t mind.... Young? Say, I don’t know,
John. You don’t think of her with years, somehow—rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
as one who has reached the top of herself
and decided to stay there.”</p>

<p>John Higgins leaned back, drained his coffee cup
and stared with eyes that smarted at the steaming ceiling.
“Is Naidu going to do us another story?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t get to that, but they gave me a novel
manuscript to read.”</p>

<p>“His?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t get it straight whose it was. Miss
Claes handed it over, suggesting I look at it for a
serial. Some one in the house had written it or left
it there.”</p>

<p>“We’d better be going back to the office. Have you
read into the novel?”</p>

<p>“Started, but didn’t get really going. It’s back-age
France stuff, and I was a little lost last night on the
subject of 54 Harrow Street.”</p>

<p>“You’re a little lost yet, Dicky, I should say—for
a Cobden.... So you’re going to lead a double life?
Rich young New Yorker, quarters in Fiftieth Street
under the eaves of St. Patrick’s, vanishing into life
down in Greenwich.”</p>

<p>Dicky’s eyes were keen with memory.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI<br />

<small>ENTER, FANNY GALLUP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap4"><i>THE Lance of the Rivernais</i> had been in the
editorial rooms of <i>The Public Square</i> for almost
a month, but there had been no report;
not the slightest mention, in fact, though author and
editor were frequently together. Richard Cobden had
come to 54 Harrow Street to live for the larger part
of each week. Pidge had gone to work in a tin-can
factory up Lenox way, pasting labels. She was half
sick from fatigue from the new work and from keeping
the secret about her book. In the days that followed
the finishing of the <i>Lance</i>, it was as if her whole body
and brain had been a scaffold or matrix for the story,
and it had been taken from her, leaving a galvanism
useless as an eggshell, a sort of afterbirth that persisted
in staying alive.</p>

<p>... There was Fanny Gallup, who sat at her right,
elbow to elbow at the pasting bench—Fanny of the
intermittent pungencies of scent and the dreary muck
of talk about boys and boys and boys. Fanny was a
child and woman all in one, about Pidge’s age and
size, one whom you could fancy had been a stringy
street-kid a year or two ago. But just now, Fanny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
was in her brief bloom, red in her lips, a lift to her
scant breast, the earth driving into her and overflowing
with such color and fertility as it could.</p>

<p>For eight hours a day, Pidge dwelt in Fanny’s frequently
tropical aura—hateful, yet marveling. The
thing that amazed her was that Fanny loved life so,
loved the feel of her own hands when she rubbed them
together, loved the taste of sweets and the memory of
last night’s kisses—loved fearlessly and without reserve,
not a pang of dread for what was to come, nor
a shudder of regret for what had happened to her
mother or sisters or the other girls of Foley Street.
Never a thought in Fanny’s head that she was being
hoaxed by Nature; that her body was being livened
and rounded, her face edged and tinted, for an inexorable
purpose; not a suspicion that she was being
played for, and must presently produce.</p>

<p>Fanny lived her brief hour to the full, and Pidge
Musser suffered and revolted for two. Pidge took
the dreary monotone of talk into her soul, as she
had taken her father’s, knowing that one day she would
be full.</p>

<p>“Oh, you Musser,” Fanny would say. “Why don’t
you come over to Foley Street?... You’re dryin’
up, Redhead. What do you do nights? What do you
do all the time, thinkin’ and listnin’?... Where’s
your fulluh, Redhead? Ain’t got one—wot? Little
liar. You’re bad, you are, because you’re so still....
Come on over to Foley Street to-night. I’ll let you
have a peep at Albert, m’li’l barber—just one peep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Redhead—not too close. I ain’t sure of him yet, but
I’ll let you have one look—aw come on!”</p>

<p>So it was through the hours, pasting apricot labels,
lobster, asparagus, pimento, peach, and codfish labels.
More and more Fanny’s boys and men folded into one,
whose name was Albert.</p>

<p>“I’m gettin’ him goin’—goin’, goin’. Psst! an’
he comes!” Fanny would say. “But I wouldn’t trust
him to you, Musser—not longer than a hairpin, dam’
little party, you.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miss Claes was observing with some concern the
result of her suggestion to Pidge, not to let the young
editor know the <i>Lance</i> was hers.</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for my tampering, she would have
heard about her book before this,” she said to Nagar.
“Pidge looked so young, I felt it would prejudice Mr.
Cobden against her work. He’s fascinated with Harrow
Street, but seems to have no time or thought for
a romance of eighteenth-century France! Yet he would
have put through her book in a week, if he knew, seeing
the story with the same eyes he sees the author.”</p>

<p>“And she doesn’t tell him?”</p>

<p>“No. That’s our Pidge, Nagar. I even suggested
that I would speak to him—let the truth slip out. She
caught me in her hands, those hard little hands, strong
as a peasant’s, ‘Not for worlds, Miss Claes!’ she
breathed, and there was a patch of white intensity across
her upper lip, ‘Not for worlds!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“... Of course, I mean to write,” Pidge had
granted to Dicky in the very beginning. “I’ve always
meant to write, since the day I learned that print
wasn’t done above the clouds somehow, like Moses’
tablets, and had to be written all out first by human
beings. But I’m not ready to begin——” and she
silently added the word “again” for her own composure.</p>

<p>“But they tell me on my floor when you first came,
you hammered a typemill day and night. Was it
commercial work?” Dicky asked.</p>

<p>“It was <i>not</i>,” said Pidge, with such emphasis that
she felt her secret endangered again and hastened to
add, “That was before I started to work in the factory.
Likely they heard Nagar’s machine part of the time.”</p>

<p>“But you seem to know yarns—like one who works
with them—tries to do them, I mean,” he remarked.</p>

<p>Her face was flushed. Evasion irritated and diminished her.
She coldly explained her father’s professional
interest in the short story.</p>

<p>“He isn’t an artist, but he teaches how, you know,”
she finished.</p>

<p>Dicky pondered long on how much Pidge meant by
this. He had been brought up to revere his parents.
Surely, he thought, she must know that one can’t be
taught except by life itself to do a real story.</p>

<p>One rainy Sunday forenoon in February, they were
sitting together in his “parlor,” the front of his two
rooms on the second floor. This room opened through
a single door to the main hall, and through folding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
doors to his sleeping quarters. Dicky had brought
some few additional furnishings from his mother’s
house in East Fiftieth Street. The place made Pidge
feel uncomfortable, but Miss Claes’ basement front
was often in use and subject to constant interruption.</p>

<p>“I want to read you something I’ve brought from
the office,” Dicky said. “I’m not saying a word—until
afterward.”</p>

<p>It was a little story called <i>Dr. Filter</i>, by an unknown
young man, named Rufus Melton. It had come to
<i>The Public Square</i> among the unsolicited manuscripts.
Pidge listened with extraordinary restlessness. She
seemed to know so much about this story, its processes
and the thing it told, that her mind was unpleasantly
crowded. It wasn’t a matter of like or dislike. <i>Dr.
Filter</i> was here in the world, a live thing. It had to
be met and dealt with.</p>

<p>“Not more than once a year, one comes in as live
as this,” Dicky said. “Yet it’s like something from a
different world from Nagar’s Little Man story.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t whether you like <i>Dr. Filter</i>, or not, but you
can’t get away from it—like a relative who comes to
live in your house,” said Pidge.</p>

<p>“That’s a center shot,” Dicky thoughtfully remarked.</p>

<p>She found herself asking about Rufus Melton.
Dicky didn’t know much, but was intensely pleased
over her reaction to his latest artistic find.... Pidge
never lacked opinions, even verdicts, nor the energy
to express them when Dicky was around. They forgot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Rufus Melton, and out-generaled time in discussing
Miss Claes.</p>

<p>“Every little while as she talks, I feel as if I were
going through a tunnel,” he said. “Of course, I admire
her, and all that, but sometimes I can’t help asking
myself, like the others, if she is really right——”</p>

<p>“The more ignorant one is, the more crazy he thinks
Miss Claes,” Pidge observed.</p>

<p>“Another bull’s-eye. Wait till I set up the target
again, Pidge. But is it because she’s Hindu—that she’s
so different?”</p>

<p>“She isn’t Hindu. She’s English.”</p>

<p>“I asked her.”</p>

<p>“So did I.”</p>

<p>“She’ll have to referee this herself,” Dicky hastily
put in.</p>

<p>Then they were silent awhile, until Pidge said:</p>

<p>“Maybe I heard her wrong. I’m sure she’s had a
lot of Hindu training. But that’s not what draws me
to her. It’s because she’s not taking it out in talk. She
knows about plumbing and cooking and streets and
common things. Best of all, she pays her bills!”</p>

<p>But Dicky, who had never known other than financial
ease and financial integrity, was more interested in the
other side of their landlady.</p>

<p>“Can one get books—on her sort of thing?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“You’re always getting me into this lately,” Pidge
complained. “I don’t like to talk about it. I floated
up through zones of Hindu stuff from a child. Better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
leave it alone, Dicky. Stay in your head—stay down.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, ‘Stay in your head,’ please?”</p>

<p>“Any one who amounts to anything stays in his
head. He’s not complicated by <i>souls</i>. All the comfortable,
solid world calls you absurd for what you
say and the way you look, when this Eastern stuff
starts you going. You get so absorbed that you lose
all touch with things down here, the things you are really
here to do. You stop making money and go around
saying the Lord will provide. You don’t really let Him,
you let other people support you and call it God’s work.
You call yourself the Elect, and yet you can’t do the
things that average people do. Mainly, you talk. You
stop work to talk. You settle heaven and God and
the soul with talk!... Oh, Dicky, that’s why I hate
it all so; that’s why I’d rather be a factory girl; that’s
why I’m all lame and tired about ‘ideals’ and ‘supermen’
and ‘abstractions’—because I’ve heard so much talk....
It’s the first thing I remember. Lying in the
crib—I began to hear my father’s voice.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve got all this stuff, Pidge. That’s what
makes you—makes you——”</p>

<p>“It is what makes me nothing! It is what keeps me
from being an honest-to-God mill girl. It is what
keeps me from everything that means something to
other mill girls. It is what keeps me from taking
life as I find it. It’s what spoils me from really knowing
Miss Claes or Nagar—or what they are about—because
so many words have been dinned into my
ears before coming to New York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>The hardest thing on Dicky these days was that
Pidge had to work in a factory. This thought was never
far from the central arena of his mind. It chafed and
irked. There was very little of the philanderer in his
breed. Mostly, the Cobdens had chosen their women
carefully, after long, cool, studious courtship. Having
decided, courted and married, nothing short of death
could break in. Doubtless Dicky’s fidelity was as stable
as that of his relatives, even though his heart had not
turned so cautiously to his light of day. Pidge had
risen in his heavens and possessed them like the rising
sun. There were not two suns in his system.</p>

<p>He had meant to live lean down in Harrow Street,
but his idea of that wasn’t native to the locality. His
ramifications for keeping clean were considerable and
very disturbing to Pidge Musser, who had been brought
up in Southern California to wear a few white garments
which she could wash herself. Washing was
impossible in her room, and wasn’t at all easy in the
hall below where Miss Claes had told her to get her
water.</p>

<p>Dicky Cobden was the first <i>gentleman</i> Pidge had ever
known. She had met several boys with a streak of
genius showing; boys who had come to her father to
learn how to write and had taken away something, if
not that. Practically all those boys had been “on a shoe
string,” and trained to get along without many things
that Cobden would have considered actual necessities,
including an established routine of order and cleanliness
in one’s person and quarters. Pidge had also met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
many of the “queer” ones of Hollywood and vicinity—men
and women who ate this way and that, bathed
this way and that, in running waters and still, in sea
waters and rain waters, in mud and sunlight, using
unctions and ointments, but they were bathing their
souls.</p>

<p>Dicky Cobden bathed frequently, carefully, believing
beyond cavil that New York and the processes of
life grimed him on the outside, that life itself was
a constant war against grime, requiring an ever accessible
tub, much soap, hot water, changes of clothing,
laundry bags, rugs, brushes. Not that Dicky gave any
thought to this. It was as if he supposed everybody
did the same. Since everybody didn’t and couldn’t; and
since everybody didn’t have as much money to spend
for bread and meat and tea, as Mr. Cobden did for
laundry alone—Pidge was miserably rebellious.</p>

<p>Always as she sat in the presence of Dicky’s altogether
thoughtless freshness; sat in her apple-butter
colored wool dress which had contained the emotional
hurl and thresh of the romantic <i>Lance</i>—always Miss
Musser had a hard time to forget herself and was frequently
on the verge of becoming defiant and bad-tempered
for reasons he didn’t dream.</p>

<p>She suffered, because every evening almost, Dicky
invited her out to dine, and not once in four times
could she pass the frowning negatives of her own
soul. He chose to regard her as superbly honest and
unaffected. She really needed those dinners, too. All
the future novels and heart throbs needed them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Occasionally she met him after dinner for a walk or
a picture, and once she had been lured to an uptown
theater. Just once—never again in the brown wool
dress!</p>

<p>She felt, as she entered the theater lights that night,
that she had been betrayed. She felt also like something
Mr. Cobden had found in the street, or that
she was helping him make good on a first of April bet.
Pidge hadn’t been to more than three “talking shows”
in all her nineteen years; to her a show house was a
place of darkness, except the screen.</p>

<p>Alone in her room afterward that night, she made a
great vow: that when the torrent of American dollars
turned loose on her (as it was bound to some time)
she would buy outright chests full of lingerie, cabinets
of hats, shelves of shoes, and a book of orders for
frocks to be delivered at future dates. She would keep
clean then if a Santa Ana sandstorm settled on New
York and lasted a year.</p>

<p>One raw and cold week-night, Pidge was about done
up when she reached Harrow Street. She tried to slip
softly past his hall door, but Dicky was there.</p>

<p>“Hard day?” he called.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, pushing on. “Everybody’s tired
and cross the whole length of New York, like a sore
spine.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t had dinner?”</p>

<p>“No, but I don’t think I’ll go out——”</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting, Pidge. There’s a little place
near, where I used to come from uptown, thinking it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
an excursion—just a neighbor of ours now, <i>The Hob
and Hook</i>, where they make a stew like Dickens tells
of in the old English inns—smoking in the pot for
twenty-four hours; and there’s tea for tired folks, and
no end of scones and honey——”</p>

<p>“Oh, please——” said Pidge. Then she added stubbornly,
“No, I’m not going out again to-night.”</p>

<p>“It is a trifle wintry,” Dicky observed. “We’ll have
supper here. I’ll go out and get an armful, and Nagar
will make us a pot of tea. Oh, I say, Pidge, have a
little thought of somebody else.”</p>

<p>She weakened. Alone upstairs a minute afterward,
she lit the gas and stood before the mirror that waved.</p>

<p>“If I turned loose just once and ate all I wanted,
he’d never speak to me again!”</p>

<small>“THE FREEDOM OF IGNORANCE”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PIDGE was gone from Harrow Street from seven
in the morning to seven at night. She had been
absolutely blurred with fatigue at the end of the
first days, but her hands were hardening, her back adjusting
to the monotonous work at the big pasting table.
She was actually learning like the other girls the trick
of sinking into a sort of coma for an hour or more at a
time. Sometimes (as one under the influence of a prying
drug, which opens scenes, as from a past life) she
would remember the palisades of Santa Monica, the
ocean pressing its white fringes up against the gray
sand; tirelessly pressing again and again, but never
leaving its white lines of foam, unless the water was
sick from the big sewer of El Segundo. Rarely a sail
on that great sunny bay, but many wings—pelicans,
sandpipers, gulls in hundreds, feeding out beyond the
surf lines, or gathered in conference on the beaten sand—three
strange and ancient bird types, gathered together
in one vast audience facing the sea.</p>

<p>This was but one of her pictures. Other times she
roamed the canyons, Santa Monica and Topango, and
the cheerful and solitary mesas.... “Yes, that same
creature—Pan Musser,” she once said, half aloud....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Then she would think of New York and Miss Claes
and Richard Cobden; of the book she had actually
written, and pretty nearly died for, the book around
which there was a conspiracy of silence. In spite of the
coma at the pasting table, and the moments of memory
drift, the stimulated laughter in the washroom, or in
the half hour for lunch as they heated their tea pails
over the radiators at noon; in spite of the clatter of tins
passing from left to right around the big table, and the
tireless goading of Fanny Gallup’s cheerful boy-talk—the
brown wool dress contained plentiful hells of the
human heart.... And to-morrow would be Thursday,
the next day Friday, the next day Saturday, and
then sleep, and this was also New York.</p>

<p>The first Sunday afternoon of March was the afternoon
of the new frock, a cheap little one-piece dress,
bought on Seventh Avenue, neither wool nor brown.
It had a tissuey and boxy smell. It was rapturously,
adventurously new. Pidge had an omen as she put it
on, that this was a sort of hour of all her life, that never
another frock would mean quite the same. She was
alone with Miss Claes when Dicky Cobden came for
her at six, according to a plan made early in the week.
They were to cross to Staten Island and find an old
Georgian mammy, whom he knew, somewhere back of
Stapleton on the wet roads, a mammy who could cook
chicken and beaten biscuit.</p>

<p>Dicky seemed only to see her face. A great wonderment
came up in Pidge’s heart, not disappointment
exactly, but a sort of soul-deep wonder, that Dicky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
didn’t appear to see the new frock. Could it be possible
that a man who managed the details of his own attire
with such practiced art had never known what she suffered
in the brown wool dress, in all that tragedy of
shabbiness and dirt? Had he really not felt ashamed
of her that night under the lights in the uptown theater?
He turned to her now:</p>

<p>“You won’t mind, Pidge, just a moment or two, if
I speak of a little matter to Miss Claes. Oh, I don’t
mean for you to leave; in fact, I’d rather not. It is just
a report about a long story that should have been made
before.”</p>

<p>Then out of the inmost heart of innocence, Pidge was
jerked with a crush. Before his next words she realized
what she must face; she, sitting aside from them in the
new frock.</p>

<p>“... About that book manuscript,” Dicky went on.
“I have ordered it sent back to you, Miss Claes—doubtless
it will be in the post to-morrow. I have read
it, and John Higgins has read it. We’re both agreed on
this particular manuscript—that it isn’t for <i>The Public
Square</i>.”</p>

<p>Pidge stared at him like a child being whipped for
the first time. All that was left of the meaning of the
book in her own body and mind, and all hope concerning
it, had suddenly been put to death. But the rest of her
remained alive in a stupor of suffering; her eyes stared.
She saw Richard Cobden as never before, saw him as
a workman; as they saw him in the office. This was a
bit of week-day that he was showing now, sincerely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
speaking to Miss Claes, having at length done the best
he could in regard to the task which she had imposed.</p>

<p>“The thing is <i>young</i>, Miss Claes,” he went on.
“There is fling and fire to it, but its freedom is the
freedom of ignorance. This love and this sort of man-stuff
would only do for the great unsophisticated. I’m
not saying that some publisher couldn’t take hold of it
and make a go. In fact, I’ve seen stuff like it in covers
mount up to big sales, but the human male isn’t handled
in it, Miss Claes. This is sort of a young girl’s dream
of what men are. They drink and fight and love and die
and all that, but——”</p>

<p>“There, there, Mr. Cobden. Don’t try so hard,”
Miss Claes said laughingly. “I’m sure you’ve given the
book its chance.”</p>

<p>But Dicky meant to finish his report.</p>

<p>“That’s just the point,” he said; “its chance with
<i>The Public Square</i> is all I’m talking about. This is a
shopgirl’s book, and there are myriads of shopgirls.
<i>The Public Square</i> would like to have their patronage;
yet one pays a price for that. John Higgins—this is
the best thing that can be said about one of the best men
I’ve known—John Higgins has never yet consented to
pay that price.”</p>

<p>Pidge Musser found her head turning from side to
side as one who tries to find in which neck muscle a
troubling lameness lies. She stopped that. She glanced
up at Cobden, who was pressing on his left glove with
his bare right hand. Before she turned, she realized
that Miss Claes’ eyes were waiting for hers. It wasn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
pity she saw in them, nor friendship, nor loyalty, nor
laughter; it was something of each of these, yet something
more. Only one word in English even suggests
the thing that was pouring upon her through Miss Claes’
eyes—and that word is <i>compassion</i>.</p>

<p>Its power could not find her heart with its healing,
but it seemed to gather around like a cloak, waiting for
entrance. Pidge wanted to be alone with Miss Claes
now. The ache was so deep that she felt it would be
worth a life if she could go into Miss Claes’ arms and
break. That was it, an utter break was the only thing
that could ease this pain. Then she became aware of
Cobden standing at her side. In a moment he would
speak. She did not wait for the moment, but arose.</p>

<p>“Shall we start down toward the ferry?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, all ready, Pidge.”</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, Dicky did not seem to
notice anything wrong. At the door Miss Claes’ hand
raised and hovered above Pidge’s shoulder, but did not
touch. Pidge was grateful for that.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII<br />

<small>SOMEBODY’S SHOULDER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was early April, a dark and rainy afternoon.
Pidge had been in the tin factory three months.
For four weeks the manuscript of the <i>Lance</i> had
lain in the bureau drawer of the little upper room in
Harrow Street, not being given a second submittal. The
secret was still kept. Richard Cobden had not spoken
of the story since his report that Sunday afternoon to
Miss Claes. There seemed an astonishing cruelty in
the fact that he could forget. He had spoken of everything
else....</p>

<p>Pidge had just left the factory and was running in her
rubbers through the blur of rain toward a downtown
subway entrance. A sort of mocking laughter was in
her ears, “and this is New York,” the burden of it. In
the dim light of the passage down into the tube she saw
the gray gleaming patches of wear on the steel steps,
slippery now from the rain. There was a shudder and
gasp from a girl beside her; a parting of the hurrying
ones ahead to avoid clotted pools of blood on two or
three steps below.</p>

<p>Farther down in the area, a man lay propped in the
arms of a stranger. His face was very white. A few
minutes before he had been hurrying down those steel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
steps that the rain had made slippery—hurrying perhaps
in the same confusion of fatigue and hunger that she
had known.... A pause had come to him from all
that hurry. His white face was more peaceful than any
of the bystanders. A hospital ambulance clanged above,
as she lingered. Attendants came down with the
stretcher. The body of the unconscious man was swept
up by one of the swift city brooms. The stream of
ticket buyers filed on as before, the downtown express
crashed in.</p>

<p>Pidge sat in her cane seat. The main crowd of the
city was coming uptown at this hour. At least, she was
spared that packing. She breathed the dense tired air,
and recalled that on a night or two before she had
slipped on the steel stairs, but had not fallen. It was
borne upon her that in some way this man had fallen
for her, fallen for every one who saw him or the puddles
of blood he left. Every one had walked more carefully
afterward, reaching for the rails. And he had lost
the sense of hurry—that unmitigated madness which
drove them all from dawn to dark.</p>

<p>Her old wonder of New York came back, as she
thought that she was being flashed fifty miles an hour
from the junction at Ninety-sixth Street down to Forty-second
Street, under the busiest streets and corners of
America. Mere men could manage much. Then the
old agony stole in—“the freedom of ignorance.” Surely
no one had ever been punished for doing a book as she
had been punished: that it was so poor, as to prove a
temptation for John Higgins to publish it, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
of its chance of falling exactly into the fancy of these—the
myriad of shopgirls in the uptown locals and
expresses, crashing by in thick ropes of white light. As
for the public taste, Dicky Cobden had told her that
John Higgins had confessed, speaking wearily and with
a smile that had lost its sting of reproach, that for thirty
years he had been choosing stories for people to read,
and every year he had been forced to lower his estimate
as to what the public taste was. Even so, John Higgins
had said he was far from the level; that only a
trade mind could get stories banal enough. But hers
might interest that public.</p>

<p>She was so tired.... For somebody’s shoulder to
lean against! Pidge knew what Fanny Gallup felt,
what the other factory girls felt, when they pushed out
so brazenly toward men—in very clumsiness from hard
pressure, spoiling their chances of being treated on the
square. Yes, she was really learning what the girls felt,
as they hunted their own in the masses of men they
passed—how tired, hungry, blurred, unsatisfied their
hearts—anything to escape the withering grind of the
mills and the counters and the shops. She knew the
secret bloom they felt, the terrible brief drive of it—childhood,
girlhood and youth, all passing like the uptown
trains—a home, a man, a child of their own, the
one chance for a breath of life. Of course, they talked
of nothing else, in the closets and dressing rooms, in
the cars and streets; and read nothing else. Certainly
their dreams had to come true in books and plays, even
if they didn’t in life. Life would break the dream soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
enough. The best life could do didn’t compare with the
lowliest dream; for the dream of a girl has glamour,
and the life of a woman is stripped. But that was no
reason why books and plays should tear off the glamour
ahead of time.</p>

<p>It wasn’t that Pidge loved shopgirls and mill girls.
She didn’t love herself for sharing their lot. She wasn’t
sentimental at all. She recognized bad management
somewhere that forced her to this work. She had to
have bread, and outer and under clothing. She paid the
price, but there was nothing good nor virtuous about it.
She didn’t hate Dicky Cobden when he spoke of “shopgirl
literature”; she knew how rotten it was, but there
was something in her that belonged to it, or she wouldn’t
have been in the factory; moreover, that something had
helped to write the <i>Lance</i>.</p>

<p>... Somebody’s shoulder. Three months of tin
cans was teaching that very well.... And there was
a shoulder, straight and steady—a kind of mockery
about it, because it was so fine. None of the girls at
the big table where she worked would have asked more.
It meant books and pictures and all the dining tables of
New York; plays and dresses, cleanliness, and all the
little coaxing cushions and covers of this arrogant modern
hour. It meant all the old solid established joys of
place and plenty; all the writing she liked; a leisurely
winning of her way through magazines and publishing
houses; nothing of Grub Street and the conspiracy
against an unknown outsider....</p>

<p>And this life of the factory—hadn’t she earned release?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
What more could come of the grinding monotony
of the days but a more passionate agony to escape,
through the under world, or the upper world, through
any route at all, even death itself? Was there a further
lesson than this?... Somebody’s shoulder. He had
the native kindness of clean breeding; also that consideration
for others of one who is brought up in a
large house. He had an ardent interest in books and
life. He was warmly established in the hearts of other
men—first and last, a man’s man, which it behooves a
woman to inquire into.</p>

<p>There was a tired smile on Pidge’s lips as the car
halted at Thirty-second street.... The only blunders
he had ever made were in her presence, because he cared
so much. He seemed continually in awe and wonder
before the thing he fancied she was, as if he had never
really looked at a woman before. Of course, another
man might act that way, but it was different the way
Dicky did it. He had been at school late, and for
nearly four years in the office of <i>The Public Square</i> he
had bored steadily, craftily toward the center of the
life of letters. Work had been his passion up to that
day in which he had called to see Nagar, and fell under
the spell of Miss Claes and Harrow Street....
There was enough of the artist and dreamer in him to
keep life from being tame, yet not enough to make life a
maze and a madness. He had health. Money was to
him like an old custom, so established as to be forgotten....</p>

<p>Fourteenth Street. Pidge didn’t hear the first call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
and hopped off with a rush at the second, pulling a
growl from the gateman as she sped out.... Dicky
was standing at the head of the stairs on the second
floor of the Harrow Street house.</p>

<p>“Hello, Pidge,” he said.</p>

<p>“Hello,” she answered, pushing past, but he caught
her arm.</p>

<p>“Let me go, please! I haven’t washed yet——”</p>

<p>But he drew her by the hand toward the open door
to his front room. The brighter light from there
streamed out into the dim hall.</p>

<p>“My hands are sticky from the paste. I’ll come back.
I’d rather come back.”</p>

<p>“It’s about that—about your hands, Pidge. I’ve
waited as long as I can.”</p>

<p>... Somebody’s shoulder. She wasn’t safe to be
trusted right now, yet she couldn’t pull away. If she
ever got upstairs—even for a minute in her own little
place, before the mirror that waved, she would see it all
clearly, but here and now she didn’t want to see clearly.
She wanted to give up and rest. She wanted what he
wanted—wanted to give him what he wanted, which
was the tiredest, most hopeless girl in New York to-night.
She was dying of all its strains and failures and
rigidities and fightings, and he wanted to take the load.</p>

<p>They were standing under the hanging lamp in his
room. The light was white; his face was white. It
was leaner than ever before, more of a man in it, more
of a boy in it. His will was working furiously to make
him speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>He held her right hand up between them.</p>

<p>“It’s about your hands, Pidge, about the factory.
Listen, you make me feel like a tout or a sot—as if you
were out killing yourself to support me. I’ve been home
two hours and you just coming in.”</p>

<p>“There’s half a million girls in New York—just
coming in.”</p>

<p>“I know. We’ll get to them later, but now there’s
only one—only one Pidge. I want her home to stay. I
want to make a home for her. Why, Pidge, I’ll let you
alone, if you just let me do that——”</p>

<p>“I believe you would.”</p>

<p>She was looking up at him hard. She didn’t fully
understand, but the boyish cleanliness of him struck her
fully that moment. The power of his will which she
felt was mainly the fierceness of his decision to speak.
It wasn’t the burn of terrible hunger for her. He was
young as a playmate: that’s what shook her now. He
wanted to fix her place, to let her hands soften again,
wanted to let her rest and breathe—not what the other
girls laughed about.</p>

<p>“Why, Pidge, I’ve got to take care of you. I’ve got
to straighten you out—if it’s only to marry you and go
away.”</p>

<p>Something in her heart cracked like a mirror, and a
sob broke out of her. It was as if a car that had been
running along by itself suddenly left the road and went
into a cliff—a warm, kind cliff. Somebody’s shoulder,
and she was sobbing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“I told you I was so tired! I told you I wasn’t
safe——”</p>

<p>“Ah, little Pidge——” he was patting her arm and
pressing her close.</p>

<p>It had come. This was it. It <i>was</i> rest. The other
girls knew. The awful cold ache was broken—warmth
of life pouring out of her—heavenly ease in the flood
of tears, and something of the dearness of dreams was
in his passion, not for her—but to do something for
her.</p>

<p>The first whip stroke fell, when Pidge remembered
how she looked when she cried. But if she could keep
her face covered! She didn’t stir.... Was this the
fullness of days? All the consummate essences of ease,
he brought—no hunger, no dirt—and really she had
fought long and hard.</p>

<p>“... Everything you want, Pidge,” he was whispering.
“I’ll take you to my mother. She’s a regular
sport, Pidge——”</p>

<p>“She’d have to be,” came from the incorrigible heart
in his arms, but not aloud.</p>

<p>The second whip stroke—<i>The Lance of the Rivernais</i>.
She had failed, and the failure wasn’t the book,
but herself, the thing in his arms. She didn’t stir, but
there was coldness of calculation to her thinking now—that
he meant ease and rest and expediency, not the ripping,
rioting, invincible man force that was to come one
day and carry her off her feet.</p>

<p>This was the third whip stroke: that he meant propinquity—the
nearest, the easiest way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>She started up and pushed him from her.</p>

<p>“I’m not washed,” she said. “I don’t mean from the
mills. I’m not washed, or I couldn’t have—couldn’t
have——! I’m just like the rest—dying for a shoulder
to cry on. You’re all right, Dicky, so right and fine
that I’m ashamed. I’ll always care for you. I’ll always
be warm at the thought of you. I’ll always remember
how I went to you—how dear you are—but you can’t
give me freedom. You can’t give me peace. My soul
would rot in ease and peace and plenty. I’ve got to earn
my own.”</p>

<p>She looked up into his face and her own took a fright
from it.</p>

<p>“I know I’ll suffer hells for hurting you—but I can’t
help it. I had to know. If I have to spend a life in
misery—I had to know that there isn’t anything you
can give that will satisfy——”</p>

<p>His mouth was partly open, his head twisted peculiarly,
and lowered, as if his shoulder and neck were
deformed. He was shockingly white under the lamp.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m such a beast and I’m so sorry. I really
wanted terribly to stay.... But, Dicky Cobden—it
wasn’t for you. It wasn’t for you that I wanted to stay—it
was for what you have—more.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX<br />

<small>“YOU BOTH HAVE KEYS”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DICKY kept his quarters in Harrow Street, but
for days at a time did not appear. Pidge
Musser at first fancied this was easier. There
was a faint cackle of derision from somewhere in her
depths, as this idea of it being easier repeated itself in
her mind; in fact, there were many conflicting mysteries
in Pidge’s deep places. “I laid my head on his
shoulder,” she once said to herself, “but thought better
of it. Now we are to be strangers.”</p>

<p>At unexpected moments when she was busy at the
pasting bench; or nights and mornings, passing in and
out of sleep, the faint note of mockery would sound.
When she passed Dicky in the halls, or met him at one
of Miss Claes’ little tea parties, and he would bow distantly
or indulge in formal commonplaces, the mockery
would stir itself in Pidge’s profundities, indicating that
something somewhere was decidedly idiotic. He looked
positively diminished as he kept up his formalities, and
she liked and respected him too much to feel pleasant
about this. She heard that he was interested in Africa.
It was to be observed that he sought Nagar; in fact,
several times she heard these two together through the
partition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>Finally Pidge heard that Dicky was going to South
Africa, possibly to hunt up Nagar’s Little Man, whose
name was Gandhi, and who had been Nagar’s friend
and teacher both in India and Natal. Also Dicky was
to do some letters for <i>The Public Square</i>.</p>

<p>On the night before he was to sail for the Mediterranean,
he was invited with Pidge by Miss Claes for
dinner at Tara Subramini’s Punjabi Fireplace down on
Sixth Avenue near Fourth Street. This was also the
night Pidge smelled Spring in New York for the first
time.</p>

<p>Mid-April; there had been rain. Pidge hadn’t caught
the Spring magic coming home from the factory, but
now as they walked down Sixth Avenue under the momentary
crashes of the Elevated—it stole up out of the
pavements as if she were in a meadow—that untellable
sweetness which seems the breath of Mother Nature
herself, a breath made of all the perfumes of all the
flowers, without accentuating one, and a sublimation of
all the passions of the human heart as well. Her left
hand burrowed under the hanging sleeve of Miss Claes’
wrap. The bare elbow there closed upon it. They both
laughed, and Mr. Richard, walking sedately, was altogether
out of the question.</p>

<p>Tara Subramini served her Punjabi dinners on great
individual plates which were none too hot. She discussed
modern dancing with Miss Claes at easy length,
when Pidge was served and Richard Cobden was not.
The rice cooled, the lamb cooled, even if the peppery
curry held its fire. The vast plate had curious little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
crevices on the side for conserves and glutinous vegetables
and various watery leaves. Pidge became prejudiced
at once against the Punjab. The great leisure
of Asia, which she had heard about from a child and
which had tempted her alluringly in the more intense
pressures of her own life, lost something of its charm
as Tara Subramini conversed with all concerned and the
contents of the troughs congealed.</p>

<p>Food is food, but talk is merely talk. Besides, Pidge
was hungry. Subramini had things to say, but also an
oriental delight in the use of English. Mr. Cobden was
unreservedly courteous. Pidge always wondered if he
really knew what hunger was. She could get so hungry
that her hands trembled, and New York had shown her
deeper mysteries of the hunger lesson that she would be
slow to forget.</p>

<p>“It must be great to be a gentleman,” she thought.</p>

<p>She positively yearned for Dicky to wake up. If this
were poise, this moveless calm of his, this unvarying
quiet and courtesy, this inability to be stretched even in
laughter—Pidge felt she was ready to drop the hunt;
also she was tempted to test out Dicky’s poise to see
how much it could really stand.... India bored her,
as well as America. Miss Claes could eat and talk at
the same time, and drop neither words nor food....
A lone Hindu arose to depart from another table. Subramini
helped him with his coat and followed him to
the door. Pidge thought once that Subramini was
about to spread herself on the doorstep and let him walk
over her. Punjab didn’t rise in her regard. Pidge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
suddenly burst out into a kind of merriment that had
nothing to do with anybody present.</p>

<p>“It is because we’re such idiots!” she said brokenly.
“Oh, I don’t mean you, Miss Claes. I mean myself and—<i>Mr.</i>
Cobden. It is the way things are done in the
world—so utterly silly. Why should we be strange and
embarrassed, avoiding each other for days and weeks—when
we should be more than ever friends, and——”</p>

<p>Richard Cobden bent forward attentively. Pidge
was turned from him.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean, Pidge, that you fail to see a reason
for this strangeness?” Miss Claes asked. “You——”</p>

<p>Pidge stared at her a second in surprise.</p>

<p>“There can’t be any sense to it, can there?” she said
slowly.</p>

<p>The other regarded her with a calm that irritated
Pidge just now. Everything irritated her, Dicky sitting
by, Miss Claes’ familiarity with Subramini, and the
look of knowing and not speaking, back of the smile
on Miss Claes’ lips. But most of all, peculiarly at this
moment, arose in Pidge’s mind the two conflicting
stories of nationality.</p>

<p>“Did I hear you wrongly that you said you were
English, Miss Claes?” she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“No, dear.”</p>

<p>“But Dicky said you told him you were Hindu——”</p>

<p>“I did. I am both. I am half-caste, supposed to unite
in myself the worst of English and Indian.”</p>

<p>Pidge burned with contrition, less at her questioning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
than at the bad temper that prompted it. The two
women were ready to go, but Dicky wasn’t.</p>

<p>“You seemed to have something to say, Miss Claes,
to set us—to set me straight on all this,” he began.</p>

<p>“You see, Richard, one cannot speak without being
drawn in. I hesitated on that account.”</p>

<p>“But I’d like to hear.”</p>

<p>Pidge flushed a little as she watched him. Tara Subramini,
still afar off, was engaged in words.</p>

<p>“... My house in Harrow Street is just a symbol,”
Miss Claes was saying. “To come into one’s house
really should mean to come into one’s heart. You both
have keys.... What was in my mind to say was that
people in your trouble act as strangers for good reasons.
If they cannot have each other—they sometimes rush
to the other extreme to save themselves the pain of
watching another come between.”</p>

<p>Dicky Cobden essayed to light a cigarette. The
match broke in his fingers. He did not try again. Miss
Claes amplified without apparent feeling:</p>

<p>“Sometimes one who cannot have what he wants—gives
way to hatred for a time to ease his wound....
Pidge, what have you to give for the friendship and
association of one who wants more?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I have anything. I see how selfish
I was. It came to me that we, of all people, should be
friends, but I didn’t look at the other side.”</p>

<p>“You can be friends, if you are brave enough. You
can be, if you dare to come and go and set each other
free utterly, but that means long and bitter work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>The harrowing thing to Pidge was that Miss Claes
talked as if Dicky and herself were one in condition and
purpose and dilemma, when in reality all the hard part
seemed to go to him. She wished Miss Claes would
stop, but the words continued with a smooth predestined
force:</p>

<p>“The best the world knows, even in books and art,
is the kingdom of two; but love doesn’t end in that—at
least, not for those who are brave enough and strong
enough to sunder their tight little kingdom of each other
and let the earth rush in between....”</p>

<p>Tara Subramini’s slippered feet crept in. She stood
behind Miss Claes’ shoulders and began to speak of a
book of poetic obituaries. The paying of the bill seemed
an interminable process.</p>

<p>Cobden looked dazed.</p>

<p>“If Pidge thinks it’s silly to act as strangers—and
I can see that it is—I’m for trying the other way,” he
repeated, when they reached the street.</p>

<p>The whole talk had been subject to most stubborn
and perverse distractions. On Sixth Avenue the racket
of traffic had become incessant. Apparently Miss Claes
had decided to say no more. Callers waited for her in
the basement room at Harrow Street, so Pidge followed
Dicky to his “parlor,” which she had not entered since
the night of Somebody’s Shoulder.</p>

<p>He seemed possessed to talk of what he had heard,
as a youth fascinated by a new course to take. He spoke
of a man being big enough to stand by and set a woman
free; of a man big enough to wait and watch and be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
a friend, a comrade. And Pidge, who had brought it
all about, listened in a sort of terror which only a woman
could understand. This thing which she had aroused in
him, this answer of his deep, but still vague powers, to
her thoughtless challenge, frightened her now that it
had come.</p>

<p>“Don’t, oh, don’t let’s talk any more!” she said at
last. “It’s talk, Dicky, just talk. The doing is different,
the doing is harder! What do we know of what
life will fix for us to do day by day through the years?
This thing is so hard that Miss Claes herself hated to
let it out. It belongs to you differently than it belongs
to me. I haven’t anything to give for your friendship
and association. I mean you’ll always want more than
I can give.”</p>

<p>He looked at her steadily for an instant.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be strangers again, Pidge. I want
to stand by and wait.”</p>

<p>“You won’t know better than to build pictures while
you wait. No one would. You will wait—while you’re
away in Africa, making pictures about me, pictures of
what I am <i>not</i>! I don’t know why I’m chosen to hurt
you. If I hadn’t been so utterly lost in myself, I never
could have brought this on. I feel that I’ve started a
new set of conditions to bring you to another moment—another
gash—like in this room the last time we were
here. And oh, Dicky Cobden, I don’t want to! To be
strangers! To be common and hateful and avoid each
other is so much more simple and easy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stop talking, Pidge,” he said quietly. “It may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
be easier to be strangers, but it doesn’t look rosy to me.
Don’t you worry about it. It is my job and I’ll take
a chance.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you’re saying!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. We won’t talk about that any more....
Now, Pidge, I’m keeping these rooms while I’m
away. Wouldn’t you—wouldn’t you for me—look
after them—look in on them and keep them alive while
I’m gone?... It would make me feel like—great,
you know.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X<br />

<small>APRIL BREATHES AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THREE nights later, when she reached Harrow
Street from the factory, Pidge found two letters.
One was from John Higgins of <i>The
Public Square</i>. This she opened first.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... At the suggestion of Mr. Cobden, just before
he left for South Africa, I am offering you a position
here as reader of the unsolicited manuscripts. Mr.
Cobden hints that you know enough about <i>The Public
Square</i> to realize we cannot be lavish in salaries, but
think we can at least pay you what you are getting
now, to begin with—and the work will be different.</p>
</div>

<p>“Oh, Dicky Cobden,” she whispered, alone in the
upper room.</p>

<p>She sat in the center of her cot as of old, breathing
the sweetness of the release from the factory....
Friendliness like this art of Dicky’s was good.... It
made her eyes smart now—the new work. It was easier
to take it from him—away. It was a soft cloak that she
could nestle in, because he wouldn’t see.... Miss
Claes knocked. Pidge read in her eyes that she already
knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“No one can ever tell you anything.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you want it, Pidge. I couldn’t tell
him for sure that you’d take it.”</p>

<p>“They really need somebody, don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cobden said you wouldn’t be in doubt about
that after you got there.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to take it,” Pidge said soberly. “I know
it means something more than it looks—but I’m going
to take it. I’m so sick of myself which fights everything.
Also, I’m going down after supper—and sit
there—in his ‘parlor.’ I haven’t entered since——”</p>

<p>Miss Claes was called from below. Pidge felt the
second letter in her hand. It was from Los Angeles,
her father’s writing. A check dropped out on the
cot. By powerful effort of will, Pidge left it there,
until she had read the note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... At this time it seems well for me to send you
money. Hard as it has been for me to refrain, I felt
before this that it was best for you to face New York
alone, unaided. As there is a New Generation, my
child, there is a New Fatherhood which dares—dares
even to allow the heart’s darling to struggle alone; dares
to say “hands off” to all the untransmuted emotions
which rush forth to shield the fledgling from the
world——</p>
</div>

<p>Fifty dollars. Pidge sank back and softly batted
her pillow with one loose arm. She laughed in a
smothery uncertain way that was not of joy.... It
was as if she heard his voice in the room—the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
parenthood, the new generation, the adjustment of
motive to moment!</p>

<p>The sort of thing in this letter always shook and
tortured Pidge. It was a part of her. She was bred
of it. She had been half as old as now when she
first realized it. Then in every thought and act, she
had rushed to the other extreme. It was true that
her father had taught her the deepest things in books.
In his study, she had caught hints of the inner meanings
of inaccessible literatures, before she had learned
to spell simple words of English. Because his eyes
hurt, she had read aloud for hours, day after day, tomes
out of Asia which she had no care nor thought to
understand, but from which, volatile fairylike impressions
came to rest in the depths of her heart. She
had loved the few central springs of books in a house
of books, until she realized that her father read, but
lived them not; that he expounded, exhorted upon the
doctrines—but his life was his own twisted rag. That
was when Pidge’s heavens cracked—and she had set
out to be honest and erect, if only as tall as a gnome.</p>

<p>The thought that came at this moment had come
before. It was the passion to be what her father was
not that had made her rush forth to be straight in
her own head—to refuse to lie to herself—to go to
the other extreme of fierceness and bleakness and ill-temper,
rather than lie to herself—to be plain and true,
if she had to be a man-hater and poison face. Yet
Pidge sat up straight with a bitter thought. Like it
or not, she saw right now that it was her father who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
had prepared her to accept and make good, possibly,
in this position with <i>The Public Square</i>....</p>

<p>“But where did he get the money?” she muttered
at last.</p>

<p>She crossed to the open window. April breathed
up to her from the stone floor of the area to-night;
magic April, breathing up through the trampled earth
and the degraded pavements. Suddenly a soft love
stole over her. It was love of the April dark.</p>

<p>She heard the sounds of the city over the buildings,
over into the stillness of Harrow Street, like the far
tread and clatter of a pageant. Mother Nature was
actually perceptible in this soft air, and something that
Pidge answered to as never before in New York. Her
hands stretched out to touch the casings of the window;
the old wood gave her an additional warmth.
It belonged to this house of Miss Claes, this house
of the mystery of kindness. She was free at this
moment of the fear of accepting too much, having
come up to breathe, at least, out of the ruck of fighting
everything and everybody. She had been utterly graceless
and narrow in her acceptances, fighting against
favors, when she knew all the time that to receive is
the other part of giving. A shiver passed over her,
nevertheless, as she remembered the subtle mendicancy
that she had known in her father’s house, the calm
acceptance of gifts and favors from others in the belief
that one was evolved enough to give the ineffable in
exchange for materials. No wonder she had run from
that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>This of Miss Claes’ was a house with a heart. This
was her house. She could breathe in it now, at least,
for a little. The numbness and dumbness of the factory
had fallen away. The softness stole over her toward
Fanny Gallup and the other girls who must still stay at
the bench. She would never forget. She had earned an
understanding of them, and had been released; <i>released</i>
was the word. But something would carry her back
to them one day, something born in that slow madness
of monotony.</p>

<p>She crossed the room and opened the door into the
hall. Supper smells came up to her, the murmur of
voices behind the shut doors. The prima donna person
was singing, not practicing this time, but singing....
“One comes up through great tribulation to learn to
sing,” Miss Claes had once said, “and others share it.”</p>

<p>The warmth stole into her from the halls. Everybody
was hungry to-night, the spring hunger, and
everybody celebrated, as a festival. April seemed
breathing in the halls, too. April was breathing in
herself; that was why she was awake to this outer
delight. If she could only keep it. It would always
be in externals, if she could only keep this springtime
alive within. She laughed a little bitterly. Of course,
she was elated because the factor had dropped away,
because the new position had opened, because the check
had come (though she felt something queer about that),
because Richard Cobden and Miss Claes were fashioned
of unswerving kindnesses, which she suddenly realized
as never before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“It’s money and place, and I’m ‘falling for’ it, venturing
to be pleased with myself——” She laughed
again. “But, oh, it is so cheerful, so restful to feel
New York like this, just for to-night!”</p>

<small>THE BABY CARRIAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PIDGE read manuscripts in the office of <i>The
Public Square</i>. She saw them first. The large
part of them were seen by no one else. It was
like being a telephone girl in a way, dipping into the
secrets of a thousand houses. But it was much more
subtle than that; the secrets more soulful and revelatory.
She saw the hopelessness of life. She saw love,
hopelessly uninviting love—puppy love, and much of
the “kidding” clever love that is made in America, and
proud of itself for that. But over all, there seemed an
anguish on the part of male and female, old and young,
<i>to express</i>. Before her were secrets of those dying
for expression; in her hands, the progeny. She loathed
the desire everywhere, because she had the same desire
herself.</p>

<p>Every one who wrote and submitted stories and
manuscripts had a “front.” In the personal letters,
accompanying their stories and articles and poems, they
told matters about themselves which their manuscripts
did not. They knew this one and that; they had influential
friends who had said this and that about their
writing. Parlorfuls of friends “had been quite carried
away by the inclosed.”... Others hadn’t wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
write. They had rebelled long; even as Saul, they had
kicked against the pricks; but for the good of others,
for the message it would carry to the world, they had
given in at last and written their story which was
inclosed.... “This is a true story,” one personal letter
accompanying said.... “This story may be finished
differently,” another wrote. “I have thought out a
happy ending, if the public is not ready to stand this
human one.”... Here was a sales manager who wrote
his personal letter with a jovial laugh: “I have just
tossed these few experiences into a story which my
friends insist belongs to you.... I wouldn’t think
of it, but I can’t help seeing what a rotten lot of stuff
the magazines publish!”... This one had decided
to write stories because she was a widow and had no
other means of support, and had heard that writing was
“the pleasantest of professions.”... And here was
one who had sent in story after story to rejection for
six years. “Some time I will win,” came the thin
tired cry.</p>

<p>Pidge had fatigued her body in the mill. She tired
her heart in the office of <i>The Public Square</i>, reaching
Harrow Street with something in her breast all sore
and shamed. This was the queer strenuous part—the
shame of it all. She, too, had fallen into expressing
herself, and they had been kind. Miss Claes had been
kind and she knew. But Dicky Cobden and John
Higgins had been kind, though they hadn’t known the
author of the <i>Lance</i>. (They would never know.)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
They had said that the writer had the fine freedom of
youth—“the freedom of ignorance.”</p>

<p>Pidge knew even better now what that meant. She
saw the freedom of ignorance in the rape of many
type machines.... The worst of it was, she herself
wasn’t through. She knew the time would come
when a new story would form within her, and begin
its knocking for life.... And this was New York,
the market place; and John Higgins sat near, and always
he held his face nearer the manuscripts toward
the end of the days, his eyes more tired and dim in the
late hours....</p>

<p>“Miss Musser,” he called one afternoon at the end
of the first month. “I wish you would go out and see
what this Rufus Melton really has to say. We took a
story of his some months ago. We had great hopes
for him, but now he’s sent in a raft of junk. Kid stuff,
this must be, he’s trying to work off. I don’t feel
like seeing him right now.”</p>

<p>In the reception room, a young man arose to meet
her, as she spoke the name, “Mr. Melton.” It was
a face you would expect to see on one of the cars of
Hollywood Boulevard, among the movie plants. There
was a catch in Pidge’s throat as she said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Higgins asked me to tell you he was occupied,
Mr. Melton. His report will go to you in a day or two.”</p>

<p>He was looking down at her, the young man who
had written the little twisted fury of a tale called <i>Dr.
Filter</i>, which Dicky had brought to Harrow Street for
her to read. She sensed that he regarded her as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
office girl, not as a reader. He couldn’t have been
more than twenty-three or four. He knew that her
words portended an evil fate for his present offerings.
It was not hurt alone in his eyes, but rage, too.</p>

<p>Now Pidge’s mind whirled back to a pair of eyes
in a baby carriage at Santa Monica; eyes of a male
infant, said to be the handsomest of that locality where
the hills and mesas break off abruptly for a sea wall.
Large, still, steady blue-black eyes of an actor that
had become calm because they were used to seeing
faces wilt before them; long, curving coal-black lashes.
Pidge hadn’t liked them in the infant; at least, they
roused her unpleasantly somehow; and she didn’t like
them now. The resemblance was deeper and more
essential than that of family, but what held Pidge really
was something she recognized, or fancied she did, something
that had to do with being broke and threatened
with hunger in New York. His clothing was fine, but
had been long used. She had a positive divination for
poverty.</p>

<p>Now his gaze was lost in her hair, as if he found
hope there. Story failures and New York, fear, and
its tough core of hunger, these amounted to one thing—but
red hair was another. The astonishing part was
the constant changing of expressions in his eye. They
reflected every mood and whim of him, for one who
could read; that is, when he forgot to veil them for
purposes of his own. Just now he seemed to be wondering
if he had better go any further with this red hair—if
he had time to play. He didn’t seem to consider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
whether Pidge wanted to play or not, only whether the
game were worth the while of one whose law was not
to let any real chance slip. Pidge had forgotten the
hurt of her message from John Higgins. She had
a pronounced feeling that she wanted to hurt Melton
some way herself....</p>

<p>“So I can’t see Mr. Higgins?”</p>

<p>“He’s been unusually rushed to-day.”</p>

<p>He laughed a little bitterly as if he understood all
that. “Are you—are you his secretary?”</p>

<p>“No, an under reader.”</p>

<p>“I see. Have you been through any of my stuff?”</p>

<p>Pidge glanced at him resentfully; she felt he wouldn’t
have asked such a question of a man.</p>

<p>“This is a sort of show-down with me,” he went
on. “I’m leaving New York. I really hoped to see
Mr. Higgins.”</p>

<p>His dilemma seemed real. It pulled her out from
herself.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry——”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you—I’d have to know before to-morrow,”
he said jerkily. “Perhaps you’d look at another story
just finished? If you would read it—there is just a
chance you might want to get it to Mr. Higgins before
I go.”</p>

<p>“Have you the story with you?”</p>

<p>“No. I was hoping for good word from one of
the others first. This new one is my last wallop. Might
I bring it to you, anywhere you say, this evening?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“You may leave it with Miss Claes at 54 Harrow
Street.”</p>

<p>“Are you Miss Claes?”</p>

<p>“No, but she will give it to me.”</p>

<p>“Could I call later in the evening also, for your answer?
It is only four or five thousand words.”</p>

<p>“You know, my reading is merely—I mean Mr.
Higgins would have to decide.”</p>

<p>“But it would help—if the story pleased you—help
to pass the night!”</p>

<p>“You may leave it with Miss Claes at the basement
entrance and call a little later.”</p>

<p>Pidge found herself walking on tiptoe back to her
desk, the catch still in her throat.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII<br />

<small>UNDER THE SAME LAMP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE manuscript was delivered while Pidge was
out to supper. She took it upstairs to
Cobden’s “parlor” and read with a nervous
interest, and an uncomfortable feeling that Rufus
Melton was looking down at her all the time. She
didn’t lose herself in the story, but the feeling persisted
that she might have done so, another time—especially if
the manuscript had come to her in the usual way at
the office. Certainly it was different and distinctive,
compared to the run of the unsolicited. It was artful,
if not art.... She heard Nagar’s quiet steady step
as he passed up to his room. She had an impulse to
ask him to read, but he wouldn’t say anything. Anyway,
he was gone now.</p>

<p>This was a story of the Tunisian sands, written, she
decided, by one who hadn’t been there; one who saw
the desert as the average American reader would expect,
but with additional flatfooted bits of color tramped
down with audacity. Moonlight was different in
Tunisia, and morals were different—freer than here.
There was the glitter of the snake’s eye through the
pages, for Pidge Musser. It made her think of a sick
man in a gorgeous robe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>She had inferred from Melton’s talk that this story
was new; in fact, that it was still hot from his machine.
Yet the manuscript didn’t feel new; the front and back
pages showed wear. Could she have misunderstood?...
It had freedom; not the freedom of ignorance,
but the freedom of a drifting ship. Its anchor dragged,
its compass was uncentered. It cried out, “My God,
I am free!” and it was, as a derelict is free.</p>

<p>At a quarter of ten, she heard the bell in the basement
hall; heard Miss Claes directing Melton to the
next floor. Pidge would not have had it this way,
but people of the house were in the basement. He
came up out of the dim stairway, walking wide, his
soft cap crumpled in his hand, elbows out. He must
have learned her name from Miss Claes.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t think, Miss Musser, that I don’t know
how much I am asking—this favor of yours to-night.”</p>

<p>There was a sort of lift and draw to the way he
took her hand; at the same time his shoulders and
head bent down upon her. This thing that he was
playing to-night was college boy—clumsy subtlety of
a big boy coming home and greeting his sister—seeing
in her, at the moment of greeting, something of the
charm other boys might see. He walked around her
under the light, laughing, apologizing, making a
humorous picture of his own tension at <i>The Public
Square</i> that afternoon.</p>

<p>“I went there like an anarchist,” he laughed. “I was
prepared to get my answer or blow up the place. I had
to laugh afterwards the way I seized upon you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“I read the Tunis story,” she said. “Of course, you
know it’s really unimportant what I think. I liked
it well enough, but wasn’t carried away. I felt the
color; in fact, color is the main asset of the story, but
it seemed a bit thick——”</p>

<p>He laughed aloud. He was bending to her again,
and most benignly, college big brother still in his manner
and voice.</p>

<p>“I could tone that down, of course. The trouble is
to get a thing like that straight, when you know that
part of Africa as I do. I ought to have kept off Tunis,
that’s the truth of it.”</p>

<p>“You have really been there?”</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of it, Miss Musser,” he laughed.
“I went through hell for that story. Too much feeling
to write with, you understand.”</p>

<p>Pidge was awed at her own error. She had been so
convinced that the color was faked that she had judged
the whole story on that basis.</p>

<p>“I’ve already asked too much of you. I’m sorry,”
he added ingenuously. “One can’t force his things
through this way. Why, I’d have given the whole six
stories to <i>The Public Square</i> for a hundred dollars,
and taken the cheapening that comes to an author from
a trick like that. That’s how I needed an answer.”</p>

<p>He had glanced up at the light as he spoke, a white,
haggard smile, that bloodless look around the mouth.
Pity caught and controlled her. She had done him an
injustice already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“You spoke of leaving New York for the west,”
she said.</p>

<p>He laughed and shrugged, palms held upward.</p>

<p>“How far? I mean where is your home?”</p>

<p>He pointed to his cap lying on the arm of a chair,
as if to say that were his home.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an aunt in Cleveland who wants me,” he
added. “A little quiet house away out on one of the
cross streets off Euclid, where there’s a room and eats
and a place to write. I’ll start to walk, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Where are you staying in New York?”</p>

<p>He was laughing at her. “A little den up in Union
Square—just a skylight. It’s a cell, Miss Musser, and
even there, I have to stay out until midnight to sneak
in without meeting the landlady.... Did you ever
sleep in a room that had no window?”</p>

<p>“Mine has a window,” Pidge said.</p>

<p>“Then this isn’t yours?” He pointed to the closed
folding doors of the inner room.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Mine’s up higher, but it has a window.
This is just a sitting room we sometimes use—Miss
Claes and I—the lodger being away.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said queerly; then added with his haggard
smile: “So the color was put on too thick—that’s
too bad.”</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Higgins know that you have been over
there in Tunis?” Pidge asked.</p>

<p>“I figured he would, but maybe he will decide, as
you did, that I sat here in New York and stabbed at
that setting.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“I’ll place the story before him to-morrow. I could
say to him that you’ve been to the desert——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t. Don’t tell him that. I was hoping,
though, that you could tell him you liked it.”</p>

<p>Pidge now looked up into a smile almost childlike
in its eager purpose.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you tell him that? Couldn’t you tell him
that—just for what others may find in the story?”</p>

<p>The catch was in her throat again. His hand rested
lightly upon her shoulder; his smile was altogether disarming
in its wistfulness. She thought he couldn’t
mean what he said. She thought of the face in the baby
carriage in Santa Monica; of this tortured child of
whims and imaginations, in a room with no window,
and the pallor around his mouth. She didn’t like any
of it, but did not feel exactly separate from it. She
thought of a little box upstairs in her own room, of
the check her father had sent, which she had so far
refused to cash. She was in a blur, her sense of belonging
to Melton’s dilemma over all.</p>

<p>“You can’t mean for me to tell Mr. Higgins what
I don’t believe,” she said. “I’ll ask him to read the
story to-morrow. If he’s against it, I could—I might
help you to pay for the room in Union Square, or—enough
to get to Cleveland.”</p>

<p>Then the thing happened which she would have
apprehended, except for her pity and personal involvement
in his trouble. She was drawn in between the
open flaps of his coat, and held there against the soft
shirt which he wore. And all through her were his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
whispers—soft delighted laughter from lips that pressed
into her hair and cheeks, searching for hers.</p>

<p>She had finally pushed him from her, and they stood
apart under the lamp. For a moment, they stared.
Then it seemed as if he studied her, as one who suddenly
revalues, doubles the value of an object. It was
the queerest, intensest scrutiny, his head cocked to one
side, the light and laughter returning to his eyes and
lips.</p>

<p>“I knew I wasn’t safe to come here,” he said. “I
knew if you did like the story, I wasn’t safe to hear
the verdict. It was the idea of getting enough money
to escape from that room, to get back into Cleveland
and find myself——”</p>

<p>Still she stared at him.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you can ever forgive me, but it
broke me wide open, Miss Musser—to find what a
ripping sport you are!”</p>

<p>“That’s about enough words,” she said.</p>

<p>He looked down.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” she went on in a dreary tone, “you
may come here—I mean to the basement entrance, at
seven in the evening, and I’ll tell you Mr. Higgins’
decision. If it’s against the story, I’ll do as I said
about your room rent and the fare to Cleveland.”</p>

<p>His hands went out to her.</p>

<p>“After what I did—you still want to do that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and now please go.”</p>

<p>Pidge was up in her own room minutes afterward,
before she realized that it had happened under that
white lamp of Cobden’s “parlor.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII<br />

<small>“MOTHER”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“A MAN’S a fool before he learns technic,”
John Higgins said, as he leaned back from
a manuscript the next afternoon. “He’s
a cripple while he’s learning it. When he’s learned it
and forgotten he’s learned it—he begins to be a workman.
That’s the freedom of knowledge.... As for
this Tunis story of young Melton’s—it’s a subtle sort
of botch.”</p>

<p>Rufus Melton came to the basement entrance at seven.
Even if Miss Claes had not gone out to dinner, Pidge
would not have taken him upstairs. He looked older,
his back had a curious droop. He glanced at her ruefully,
and around the room. Pidge stood beside the
table.</p>

<p>“Mr. Higgins didn’t care for your story,” she said.
“It has happened unluckily all around.”</p>

<p>His head had bowed before she began to speak.
His eyes came up to her now, full of contrition and
pain.</p>

<p>“I think the hardest thing I ever did was to come
here to-night. Only one thing made it possible. I’d
have started west, only New York is a curious old
dump.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“How is that?” she asked warily.</p>

<p>“You have to go north to go west. I mean the
only way out is north, for a pedestrian.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t enough for the ferry or tube?”</p>

<p>Their eyes met.</p>

<p>“What I said last night holds good, you know,” she
said with effort.</p>

<p>He turned slowly to the door as if in indecision, and
Pidge watched. She knew she could make him take the
money, but she wanted him to be ready to die first.</p>

<p>“There was nothing in the other stories, either—from
Higgins’ point of view?” he asked.</p>

<p>Pidge was white. She felt like an executioner. “The
package was mailed back to you to-day.”</p>

<p>For just an instant his head was bowed again, half
turned to the door. Then he veered around and his
hand came out to hers.</p>

<p>“Good night,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good night. But you—that quiet room in Cleveland——”</p>

<p>He shook his head with a slow, dawning smile.</p>

<p>“It’s great to know you. I’ve heard about such
people being here in the Village, but it’s—‘It’s fourteen
miles from Schenectady to Troy.’”</p>

<p>“It’s a long way to Albany before that,” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s a long way to One-Hundred-and-Tenth Street,
Miss Musser, but it is easier than taking money from
a girl.”</p>

<p>She breathed relief. “I came to fight it out here in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
New York on the same terms you did,” she said. “You
can pay me back.”</p>

<p>Now his back was toward her, his face uplifted.
She saw his hand grope for the knob of the door,
and his shoulders rock weakly. She caught his arm
and pulled him back to a chair.</p>

<p>“You see, you really couldn’t get away.”</p>

<p>He had suffered her to lead him to a dining-room
chair, and sat very still, his head tilted back, eyes closed.
She took the little package of bills from her dress and
tucked it into his hand. There were voices in the hall;
a vague frown crossed his white temples.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he said queerly.</p>

<p>“You are faint. I’ll go with you to a near place
for something to eat. That’s all you need. Come—if
you can walk a little way.”</p>

<p>He stood in a sort of confusion, holding the folded
bills in his hand as one would hold a card.</p>

<p>“Put that in your pocket,” she said, but he did not
seem to comprehend.</p>

<p>They were in the street, her hand steadying him.
They found a dim restaurant with a counter and a
few tables. He did not speak until the waiter came;
then asked for coffee. Pidge had taken the money
and thrust it into his coat pocket. Now she was tormented
with the fear that he would lose the small roll,
not knowing that he had it. She had not brought her
own purse. He would be forced to pay; then he would
have to see what he had.</p>

<p>He drank the coffee first, then ate sparingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“I learned that in the desert,” he said at last.</p>

<p>“Learned what, please?”</p>

<p>“Not to go mad over the taste of food when one
has been without.”</p>

<p>The girl who waited on the table looked devotedly
into Melton’s profile as she served. Twice as he started
to speak, the Sixth Avenue elevated crashed by outside
and he seemed to forget what he meant to say. It
seemed more true here in the restaurant than it had been
in the house in Harrow Street, that he was wonderfully
good to look upon. The realization held a small tumult
for Pidge. She was altogether different with him than
with any one else. They had finished, and still he
lingered.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I hadn’t intended to come out. I left
my bag upstairs. Will you please pay?”</p>

<p>To his illness, a look of embarrassment was now
added.</p>

<p>“It’s in your pocket. Right there——”</p>

<p>She pointed to his coat, and he drew out the bills
wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember,” he said dully.</p>

<p>While the waitress was away bringing the change,
he shoved the rest of the money across the table to
Pidge, but she pushed it back, saying quietly:</p>

<p>“I want you to fix up the room rent and get a night
train west. We’ll say no more.”</p>

<p>His lips whitened under a curious tightening.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out in the dark,” he said roughly.</p>

<p>They walked back to Eighth Street and over to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Avenue, entering the Square that way. The sooty grass
was soft and damp; the faintest trace of fog among
the trees.</p>

<p>“You’ve got something on me,” he was saying
strangely. “You’re not like a girl, but like a woman
and a pal, too. You had something on me last night,
or I wouldn’t have fallen for you that way.”</p>

<p>“When you get back to that Cleveland room—perhaps
a real story will come of all this.”</p>

<p>“A real story,” he repeated.</p>

<p>His eyes were bright and the pallor of his face intense
enough to be visible. She was conscious of his
inimitable charm as his head inclined to her and she
heard his words in the lowest possible tone:</p>

<p>“Meeting you—that is the real story.”</p>

<p>She pushed away his hand that had lifted to hers.</p>

<p>“You’re all right now. I’m going back. Good night
and good luck.”</p>

<p>He made no attempt to detain her.</p>

<p>That night Pidge lay for a long time without sleep.
She was forlorn and troubled and restless, but underneath
it all there was a queer little throb of happiness,
like the recent night of the two letters. It would not
be stifled. Every time she could get still enough, she
was conscious of it, like the song of a bird that kept
on and on, but was only audible in the lulls of almost
unbroken traffic. She awoke in the night with the
thought of him speeding westward on his train.</p>

<p>The next night when she came home there was another
letter from Los Angeles, another check dropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
out, and a clipping, which she read first—the wedding
announcement of “Adolph Musser, the noted metaphysician,
and Mrs. Hastings, wealthy widow of the
late Rab Gaunt Hastings, firearms manufacturer of
New England, at the Byzantine,” etc.</p>

<p>Pidge didn’t have her guard up. The choke and
the shame were too swift for her self-control. For
the first time in many days the tears broke, the extra
scaldy sort. If she had only been permitted to keep
that first check uncashed for a few days longer!...</p>

<p>The next was a day of dullness and misery, a May
day of rain. Crossing Broadway, as she hurried to
luncheon, she passed Rufus Melton in the crowd. Her
lips parted to call, but she checked in time. He hadn’t
seen her. She found herself standing loosely in the
traffic, her hand to her mouth, until a taxi driver roared
at her, and she swung into the stream of people again
and reached the curb.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV<br />

<small>ISOLATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PIDGE was leveled with personal shame. Try as
she would, she was as lacking in the ability to
detach herself from Melton, as from the influence
of her father. She had felt the boy’s power over
her, and knew innately that she would feel it again; that
this sort of thing wasn’t a mere touch and go; that meetings
like this, which appear sporadic on the surface,
have twined roots beneath. She had been taught from
a child that nothing merely happens. The incentive that
made her lend him the fifty dollars, which she had held
uncashed for nearly a month, did not mean to her now
a mere impulsive mistake. It was a symbol of a giving
to this boy—of a blind but eager something out of the
depths of her heart.</p>

<p>Late in June a letter came to her from Dicky Cobden,
who was at Coquihatville on the Equator, where as he
said, “the sun’s rays fall as straight as a tile from a
roof.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Oh, yes, you and Miss Claes knew a lot more
than I did that night at Tara Subramini’s. I shot off
a lot of words afterwards. Never again. But I’m
going to stay with it, Pidge.... I’ve just had ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
days here in the jungles, back on one of the tributaries
of the Kong. If I stayed long here, I would see it all
as these exiled white men do; that God is a rubber man
with ivory legs; that the natives are vermin, not only
to be walked over, but to be stamped into the ground.
They whimper so. It’s too hot here to be whimpered
at.... I think so much about you. Of course, this
isn’t news to you, but I say it, because it is so different
from what I thought it would be. Something snapped
when I got to the Kong.... All fat and decoration
are sweated off down here. I reach out to you just the
same. Only in New York I thought that we were both
wrapt in the same sort of film, a tinted filmy sort of
glamour that stretched out as we went different ways.
That film was stretched too hard. When I reached the
River it snapped. I think I’ll never get over feeling this
awful isolation of being a separate creature from everybody,
worst of all from you....</p>
</div>

<p>... Next morning in the office John Higgins called
her in to his desk. “Dicky has sent in some stuff. We
begin to publish in August.”</p>

<p>He took off his spectacles and wiped them on the
flap of his necktie. His eyes looked watery, as if the
light had run out in tears.</p>

<p>“I’ve always heard that the Cobdens were honest,”
he went on, “three generations of honest men. They’ve
built something, Miss Musser. Not a business, that’s
well enough, but they’ve built a man. Listen——”</p>

<p>He opened the pages at random and began to read.
It was like the stuff in her letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“It’s so for pages and pages,” he continued. “Every
word standing out, if you get the hang of it. No tint,
no art; just words, pain-born, separate like boulders in
a field. He has no hopes, yet he writes what he sees....
Something seems to have happened to our Dicky,
besides Africa.... He watches the string of natives
coming in with their tusks; he watches the crocodiles
coming up to the blinding surface water; he watches
the big monkeys that live in twos, and the little monkeys
that live in troops. I don’t know what the world’ll get
out of this, but I know what I get out of it——”</p>

<p>She saw that John Higgins was merely thinking out
loud. A few moments later he finished:</p>

<p>“This stuff amounts to the most subtle and incredible
rearraignment of imperialistic cruelty, but Dicky
doesn’t mean it that way. He keeps repeating with
devilish calm that it isn’t so bad as it was. It’s no
particular nation, but all whites. He writes from the
standpoint of a white man who remembers Cortez in
Mexico, Pizarro in Peru, Warren Hastings in India,
Cecil Rhodes in Africa and our own dear religious
settlers bringing Yankee wits and rum and disease to
the red Indians. He turns over the pages of all
patriotic histories with a long stick as you would poke
the leaves from the face of a corpse you had made
yourself. His face tries to turn away; his stomach
retches, but he knows each man and each nation must
bury his own dead.”</p>

<p>“‘Something seems to have happened to our Dicky,
besides Africa,’” Pidge repeated, when she was alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>Summer days in New York, sleepy stewy days. The
low clouds made the nights hot. Pidge was used to
the “high sky” of Southern California where every inch
of shadow meant coolness, where cool night fell quickly
no matter how hot it had been in the sun, where there
were no afterglows, nor afterheats, and you wanted a
wrap the instant the sun went down. The meaning of
summer in New York became a cruel meaning, in the
little room off the area. It gave her an astonishing
grasp of what people suffered in the tenements.</p>

<p>Two weeks after the copy arrived from Africa, the
galleys came up on the Cobden articles, and Pidge asked
permission to take a set home to show two friends of
Dicky’s in Harrow Street. John Higgins acquiesced.
Pidge delivered these to Miss Claes and forgot all
about it, until the next night when she returned to the
house after dinner, and Miss Claes called her from
the door of Cobden’s “parlor.”</p>

<p>“Come in, Pidge, and we’ll shut everything out.”</p>

<p>Nagar was within and the galleys were stretched out
under the light. Pidge had never seen Miss Claes and
Nagar quite like this. They appeared happy over something
they had found in Dicky Cobden’s isolation and
melancholy—happy as in the news of a legacy.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you see?” said Miss Claes strangely.
“He’s pondering on Life! He thinks he’s reporting—when
really he is giving himself to Life. The world
stretches out before his eyes without glamour, stripped.
He offers himself to it, but his writing contains a confession
with the weariness of the ages on it, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
has nothing to give—that he is a sham like all the rest.
There’s not a self-pose in all his pages.”</p>

<p>Nagar had slipped out. Miss Claes came close and
added softly:</p>

<p>“Richard is finer than we knew, Pidge. What happened
here in this house has prepared him—always the
wrecker before the builder.”</p>

<p>“You mean, I’m the wrecker?”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have done differently.... Too bad
he isn’t to see Mohandas Gandhi. Nagar has received
word that the Little Man is returning to India. Richard
didn’t go to Natal first.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be so sorry,” Pidge said. “It was Nagar’s
story that drew him to Africa——”</p>

<p>Their eyes met; no need to amplify.</p>

<p>“Dicky’s so deadly in earnest,” Pidge went on. “He
sees what he sees the same at ten in the morning and
at ten at night. His coming to Harrow Street didn’t
mean a whim. His part that night of our Punjabi
dinner didn’t mean a whim. Oh, but I’m so glad he
hasn’t started out to save the world!”</p>

<p>“He’s preparing to work better than that.”</p>

<p>“I feel so ungrateful for not missing him more,”
Pidge added unsteadily, “for not being more interested
in this that pleases you. I can appreciate, but oh, Miss
Claes, I don’t belong to your way of seeing things. I’ll
always be Dicky Cobden’s hangman, always hurting
myself more!”</p>

<p>They were standing close together.</p>

<p>“Nothing matters to me but myself!” Pidge moaned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
“I’m hopelessly lost in myself—that’s what’s the matter!
What room have I for Africa or the world?
There’s more to me in the struggle of John Higgins not
to get drunk—in the body hunger and body love of
Fanny Gallup—in the lies of Rufus Melton! I can
understand this world-service thing—oh, I can see the
nations like chessmen on the table!—but I can’t fix
Fanny Gallup or John Higgins, I can’t fix Rufus Melton.
I can’t fix myself!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XV<br />

<small>THE COBDEN INTERIOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PIDGE heard about the assassinations in Bosnia
as wearily as of a murder in little Sicily. She
heard rumors of war in Europe with ennui—how
could there be energy enough left in the human
race to make war? She met Nagar in the lower hall
at Harrow Street on the evening that war became a
fact. He looked like a dead man walking in the twilight.
She didn’t see Miss Claes at all that night.
The next day in the office war began to show its personal
aspects to Pidge Musser of Los Angeles. John
Higgins was hours late in returning from lunch. She
saw that he wouldn’t be down at all to-morrow. He
looked old. He had on a black frock coat, as if dressed
for pallbearing, though his face looked as if he were
about to be borne himself. The little office was fumy,
sweetish.</p>

<p>“Our blessed Savior moves in mysterious ways,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>Pidge lingered at the door to get any significance
that this might have for her.</p>

<p>“The Lord gives and the Lord takes away,” he added,
sitting back straight in his chair.</p>

<p>He removed his spectacles and reached for the flare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
of his tie to polish them off, but no tie dangled to-day.
It was a little black store-made bow, fastened with a
clip over the collar button. Pidge still lingered, her
hand on the knob.</p>

<p>“Blessed be the name of the Lord,” said John Higgins,
“but it’s hell on us.”</p>

<p>She started out, but was called back.</p>

<p>“I need an audience, Miss Musser. I need a female
ear. I need ladylike sympathy. It isn’t sweet of you
to run off.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>The editor looked at her, squinted, put on his spectacles
and looked again.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you don’t know what’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>“Everything is the matter,” said Pidge. “But what’s
new?”</p>

<p>His hand nearest her lifted and rested upon a pile
of page proof on his desk.</p>

<p>“Dicky Cobden hasn’t written a line from the Kong
that we can publish. We’ve cabled him to come in,
though he’s probably started. You’ll recall that Belgium
lies between France and Germany. She’s holding
the Germans off from Paris, giving France and England
a chance to get set. Belgium’s the world’s public square
right now, the one vortexical spot on the face of the
earth. Doesn’t it occur to you that even a new angle
on her sins in the heart of Africa is about as much in
time and place right now, as Paul Revere’s ride?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>... Three weeks later, she heard that Richard
Cobden was in town; that John Higgins had seen
him the night before. All that day at the office she
kept listening for his step and voice, but he didn’t come.
His car was in front of the Harrow Street house, however,
when she reached there, and a light showed
between the doors from his “parlor.” She lost some
of the sense of suffocation when she saw that, a curious
gladness for a moment. She tapped the door with her
finger tip, pulled the curtain aside ever so little and said:</p>

<p>“Hello.”</p>

<p>A quick step in the inner room; then he was before
her in the doorway, drawing her in under the light.</p>

<p>“Pidge—Pidge,” he repeated.</p>

<p>The boyish look was gone from him. He might
have been taken for ten years older. The thing had
happened that takes place abruptly in many Americans,
more among business men than artists: Youth had
been put away, its trace of divine humor exchanged
for adult seriousness.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come to the office to-day, Dicky?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see you here—like this.”</p>

<p>They were standing under the light.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re different,” she said.</p>

<p>“John Higgins said that. They told me so at home,
uptown. I feel different, but it isn’t an improvement.
And you, Pidge, you’re taller. And John Higgins
says you’re doing so well.”</p>

<p>“I’m thanking you every day for that——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>She kept thinking about the change in him. If this
were selflessness, she liked him better before. He had
been quite unselfish enough, she thought. She didn’t
see the fight in him, because it was so subtly identified
with herself. She only knew that he seemed without
fight.</p>

<p>“Keep on your things, Pidge. We’ll go out somewhere——”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That was the beginning of strange days and evenings.
They played at the old game of <i>Comrades</i>. Often they
lunched together, occasionally with John Higgins for
a third. At such times it seemed that they took <i>The
Public Square</i> with them, subscribers, advertisers,
contributors, policies. It was that curious time in
America when the personal and national meaning of
the European war was breaking through with all its
paralyzing ramifications; when all who were sensitive
at all reflected division and strife in themselves, as a
deep leveling sickness.</p>

<p>Pidge was taken to the Cobden home, a new and
terrifically complicated modern apartment in East
Fiftieth Street, but the furnishings, the household
ceremonials, the people themselves, suggested prints of
New York interiors in 1870—respectable, established,
grim. The gradual speeding up of the world for a half
century to the explosive point of 1914 ended with the
click of the key in this hall door, and you were in the
world of another day, with a spinster aunt, a widowed
mother, an unmarried sister, a slowly disintegrating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
grandfather, and Dicky himself, not in a different guise
at all—the same courteous, sincere Dicky, but now to
Pidge Musser’s western eyes, utterly, revealingly comprehensible.
This was the place that had made him.
This was his reason for being.</p>

<p>Here life was life. Here was the family unit, the
family a globe, all human society moving outside like
the water around a bubble; a closed globe reflecting all
else in curious unreality. Here three-score-and-ten was
life, and a very long time. Life wasn’t a spiritual experiment,
in matter; not an extension in matter of
souls that had made innumerable such experiments, but
straight work-a-day three-score-and-ten with oblivion
at the birth end, and heaven or hell at the other. Here
was All Time, in which it behooved man and woman
to gather worldly goods and religious goods and love
one another and hang together—for the rest was with
God. Here senility was dear. The heavy-bodied, dim-minded
grandfather was still grandfather, not the vanishing
spirit of him. They would weep when the body
passed. They would look to his place in the cemetery
and say, “Here he lies.”</p>

<p>Pidge Musser wanted to scream, not at the limitations,
but at the kindness which was showered upon
her. They were ready to perform the great transaction
of taking her in, opening their hearts and house to a
maiden, who would bring respectable additions to the
Cobden line—sharing wealth, well-being, gentleness, the
Cobden name which had been kept clean and useable
and virile, and the Cobden God, who stood on the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
side of death with angelic associates and rewards in
His hands.</p>

<p>Pidge continually felt that her next word would ruin
everything; yet they unswervingly regarded her as becoming
one with themselves; the process of assimilation
already begun. They were patient, knowing of old that
a new maiden would have incrustations of the world
to check off, inequalities to be planed down. They
set about not adjusting to her, but as she fancied,
assimilating her, as the changeless Chinese assimilate
a weaker race, breaking down the foreigner in themselves.
She would become theirs to them with the
years.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dicky,” Pidge said, when they were in his car
again. “I see. I understand. How did you dare to
open those doors to me!”</p>

<p>“I spoke of you at home, Pidge. They wouldn’t
have understood if I hadn’t brought you soon. They
were prepared to open their arms to you. They have
their laws——”</p>

<p>“But they are your laws. Dicky—how did you dare?
Is it because you don’t know me, don’t see me at all?
Do you see something which you want to see, that has
nothing to do with me?”</p>

<p>“What is it that troubles you so?”</p>

<p>“Myself—always and forever myself! Oh, don’t
you see I have nothing to do with them? Why, you’re
comfortable, Dicky—your people are comfortable!
<i>This</i> is life to you—this, here and now! It isn’t to
me. Life’s an exile to me, a banishment and coldness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and pain. In all New York there are not two such
opposites. My God is far away. Yours is here—a
Person.”</p>

<p>He answered hopelessly: “I can see how it would
strike you, but I couldn’t cover up on account of that.
I belong to them. I’m of them. Any front I might
put on wouldn’t wear. You had to see us, Pidge——”</p>

<p>Another time she might have seen the fine thing
back of those words, but she took such finenesses of
Richard Cobden for granted, while he rarely could
understand that she saw anything but his faults.</p>

<p>“It’s queer,” he said, in the same dull hopeless way.
“I stand to you as the most staid and changeless person,
but to my family I am dangerous, a fulminant.
They love and trust me, but watch me with fierce concern.
Already I’ve broken more Cobden convictions
in twenty-five years than all my relatives in all their
years.”</p>

<p>His face glanced wearily toward her from the lights
of the street, as he drove.</p>

<p>“You’ve let me understand too much for one Sunday
afternoon,” she said in an awed voice, “and it feels
colder and lonelier than ever before. I even see something
of the coming years, Dicky. I see that it means
Fate, when you say ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ I see that you turn
to a girl to stay. I see you don’t cheat. I see that
I’m volatile compared; that my honesty is a fierce effort,
a deadly self-conscious effort, and yours is an established
habit. I’m clumsy at my honesty. I love it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
terribly, but it is still on the outside of me—something
to attain.”</p>

<p>She sank back, laughing. “I wonder if it will stay
as deadly clear as this?”</p>

<p>“You are not making it quite clear to me,” he said.</p>

<p>“I must. Oh, I must. Dicky, please open your soul
and listen to me—hard, hard! While it’s clear, I must
talk. You’ve chosen to be my friend. You’ve chosen
not to take the easier course of hating me. I understand
all that better now than the night of the Punjabi
dinner.”</p>

<p>“I do, too,” said Cobden, and bitterness of the African
rivers was in his words.</p>

<p>“Do I have to begin by saying how dear you are—how
kind, how utterly good it is to know you; what
it means to have faith and trust in one man?”</p>

<p>“Please not, Pidge.”</p>

<p>“But never forget it, Dicky. It’s the pedestal upon
which everything’s builded. Always remember that I
know you underneath; that I turn to you in trouble—not
like a brother or father or lover, but what our
word <i>comrade</i> means—what it will sometime mean to
many people! That’s you. But, Dicky, because I
know you—I can look away! Don’t you see—you’re
like something done! Having found you, I can turn
to other things.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to see that, but most people find each other
differently, to stay——”</p>

<p>“It’s because they don’t find what I’ve found. I
don’t know what I want, only I know there are terrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
undone things in me, that other people stir to life.
I’m lost in persons. Miss Claes and Nagar lose themselves
in nations. You’re getting to be like them, but
I see it all in the personal!... Listen, Dicky, if you
were to get a woman to take to your house—one ready
to go in and be a Cobden and a mother of Cobdens—I
could love her! I could hold to you just as close,
though secretly. I would expect you to be my <i>comrade</i>
just the same—I mean just between us—never on the
outside, perhaps. What I mean is, it wouldn’t hurt
me—not the thing we have together.”</p>

<p>His car had come to a stand in the stillness of Harrow
Street, but still they sat.</p>

<p>“What you mean is—you haven’t any place for me
as a lover or a husband.”</p>

<p>“That’s like you, but that’s it.... Dicky, you mean
to me something done, something found. I don’t dare
to turn to you and rest. The savage undone things in
me <i>won’t</i> rest! They demand experiences, life—and
no one knows better, that they mean pain ... and oh—under
your lamp—it’s horrible to tell it, but you’ll
forgive me later, when you see that it had to be
told——”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about, Pidge?”</p>

<p>“Under your lamp—in there! He came about a
manuscript. He was broke and needed help—all his
stories refused. He asked to see me that night. Miss
Claes’ basement was occupied. She sent him up. We
talked. He wanted something, money, everything.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
Under your light—he took me to him, his coat
open——”</p>

<p>Cobden startled her, as he cleared his throat. The
silence between them had been so deep.</p>

<p>“It meant nothing to him! He was used to it. It
was only his way to get something—money most, he
wanted. It was just as he might take a waitress or hall
maid—used to having girls ‘fall for’ him. This is
what I mean—though I understand him, a theatrical
mind, a liar—life meant something to me that instant,
that it never meant before. Something I must do,
something calling—pain, but something I haven’t
done!”</p>

<p>“You mean—you mean—it isn’t over?”</p>

<p>“Just that, Dicky, and oh, forgive me! I may not
see <i>him</i> ever again, but <i>something in me</i> isn’t ‘over.’ I
had to tell you—to be honest, to learn to be honest.
You’ll be glad some day!”</p>

<small>DICKY FEELS A SLUMP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was nearly a week afterward when Pidge heard
sounds, not of meeting only, but of mauling, from
over the partitions of Richard Cobden’s office at
<i>The Public Square</i>. Her desk was now in John Higgins’
room. The racket was “young”—something of
the sort you expect in a college fraternity house, rather
than in the editorial rooms of a magazine of dignified
social protest and short story ideals. John Higgins
winced and glared. Now the stranger’s voice was
upraised:</p>

<p>“You’re not seedy, Dick—you’re decayed! If Africa
treats a man like that, I’m off the Sahara for life.”</p>

<p>Pidge heard this with something of the sense of
personal arraignment. The ugly part was that it was
true, and it hadn’t been the truth a week before. Dicky
had been changed when he arrived, but the change since
their ride home from his mother’s apartment in Fiftieth
Street was more definitely disturbing. She found John
Higgins’ eyes upon her and started guiltily. He leaned
forward to whisper:</p>

<p>“It’s a fact. Something’s eating our Dicky. He’s
losing his bounce.”</p>

<p>For once, Pidge did not altogether blame herself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
There had been no two ways about telling him what had
happened under the light. She had been challenged to
speak on their first evening together after his return,
challenged every hour of the week afterward; and yet
it was not until after the words were out, spoken in
her particularly ruthless and unequivocal way, that she
actually saw the power of their hurt.</p>

<p>In Africa Dicky had stripped himself of hope, in the
most complete way he knew. Africa is said to have a
way of helping a man in this. Doubtless he had winnowed
this hope down to a semi-impersonal concept,
that straight, clean devotion would win its reward. But
Africa alone was one thing, and New York with Pidge
was another. He had been entirely innocent of the possibilities
of pain his heart was capable of.</p>

<p>Still they went out together. They tried, furiously
tried, but the star toward which they had held their
eyes, the star named <i>Camaraderie</i>, was for the present
out of their sky. She tried to give herself in
interest to his particular studies of world politics. His
views had nothing to do with intuition or prophecy.
Dicky gripped affairs on an academic basis of economics,
and the only light he had to work with in
relation to the turmoil in Europe was from the same
friction that had furnished his sparks in Africa—the
pain of his own heart. He told her of the delicate
and dangerous adjustments between the nations, as
he saw them; the organic play, the push and pull on
every national boundary; the draw of Russia upon
India, for instance; the grim hold of the British bulldog;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the interatomic play of India, Ireland and Egypt;
the poison vats of the Balkans, the frowning menaces
of the Levant. One night he spoke of Italy’s inner
and outer stresses, and of her age-old hatred for
Austria.</p>

<p>“And Pidge,” he said quietly, “you won’t mind my
saying it, will you? I see it all so clearly when I talk
to you. I know you’ll tell me that you don’t know
anything about these things. You always tell me that,
but you certainly make me know them better.”</p>

<p>And another time when they were going out together
in the evening and she had come down from the
upper floor with her wrap which he took for a moment:</p>

<p>“I’m sure you won’t mind, Pidge,” he said, “if I
tell you that the little things you wear quite take me
over. They actually hurt, and I never saw you look
quite like to-night.”</p>

<p>This was the quality—more like the words of an
older man; a touch of sentimentality upon them, as if
he were diminished in her presence, something in him so
whipped it did not dare appear on the surface. This was
unpleasant to Pidge. The changeless want in his heart
suffocated her at times; then her affection changed to
revolt. She became irritable and uncentered, her temper
hard to govern. She wanted freedom—freedom for
something utterly undelineated, but freedom to Life
(in Miss Claes’ meaning of that word of words) and
she saw him in such times as one who stood in her way.</p>

<p>One night in the little upper room, in her own particular
time of self-revelation, as Pidge lay on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
borderland between sleep and waking, she saw herself
like an ogre, and Dicky Cobden like a terrified child
in a great house, and she was driving him from one
room to another, from one floor to another, to an inevitable
cornering in the farthest wing.</p>

<p>Finally an early October evening, and again his car
had halted before 54 Harrow Street. Pidge sat beside
him, but Dicky had not opened the door.</p>

<p>“Pidge,” he said suddenly, “I’ve got to the end of
my rope. I’m not making good. I’m all blurred on
what we’re trying to do. It’s—it’s too much for me
here.... I don’t want France or Flanders. I’m going
into the Near East for <i>The Public Square</i> and a newspaper
syndicate.”</p>

<p>“I knew it. I felt it coming, at least,” she said.
“And I’ve failed, too, all the time. But, Dicky, back
of everything, I know there must be somebody laughing
at our seriousness and stupidity. We’ll see the puzzle
straight some time. You’ll see.”</p>

<p>They both were sitting straight up.</p>

<p>“Nobody’s—nobody’s shoulder?” he asked with terrible
effort.</p>

<p>“No, Dicky. It would only fog us up—all the more.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVII<br />

<small>NEW LODGERS FOR HARROW STREET</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PIDGE MUSSER was ending her second year
in the editorial rooms of <i>The Public Square</i>,
when a short story came in from Rufus Melton.
Meanwhile, his work had begun to appear in magazines
of large popular appeal. This manuscript, called <i>The
Boarded Door</i>, had doubtless not fitted into any of
them. The chief thing about the story to Pidge was
that her cheeks burned as she read.</p>

<p>This made her angry. Another thing, the story
was so familiar to her. She seemed to be in and out
of Melton’s mind, hearing his typewriter, understanding
even his corrections. But also she saw what the
author could not—his fluctuations of fancy, which
uncentered the tale.</p>

<p>“He’s beginning to be read,” said John Higgins.
“It’s not a bad story. We’d better take it.”</p>

<p>“It is not his best work. There’s a cavity in it,”
said Pidge. “If it were by a new name altogether,
we’d write the author suggesting that he work over the
weak part.”</p>

<p>“Do it,” said John Higgins.</p>

<p>Pidge laughed nervously. “He won’t like it,” she
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Don’t mind that. Rufus Melton can write. He’ll
have his hour, but go ahead and scuttle the ship, young
woman. We don’t care about pleasing our passengers.”</p>

<p>Back at her own desk, Pidge was smitten with the
idea that she wasn’t being fair. In the course of reading
Melton’s story, she had not once forgotten that he
had failed to pay back that fifty dollars. Not only that,
Rufus Melton hadn’t mentioned it; and he was said
to be making money right now. She had to write the
letter to Melton three times. Films of ice formed on
the sentences and had to be skimmed off, in spite of her
most rigid effort. She carried the sheet, signed by
“The Editors,” to John Higgins, with a restless feeling
that damage was done.</p>

<p>“That’s just like what Dicky Cobden would say,”
he remarked, handing it back. “Send it along with the
manuscript.”</p>

<p>Pidge wasn’t allowed to forget Dicky Cobden, though
Richard, himself, was across the world and remained
across, apparently groping to find the exact antipodes
from Washington Square, New York. Between Miss
Claes’ affection for him and John Higgins’ and
Nagar’s; considering her occasional use of his “parlor”
in Harrow Street and her daily use of his old desk
in the office, to say nothing of the position she occupied
through his kindness and care—no, she wasn’t being
allowed to forget.</p>

<p>About the same time that Rufus Melton’s story came
in to the office, a dingy bit of white paper came to
Harrow Street for Pidge. It was like a paper you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
would see in the street around a public school building.
Pidge was awed at the unfailing magic of the post-office
authorities, that the letter had ever been delivered.
It was from Fanny Gallup, who had married Albert
and left the pasting table shortly after Pidge’s change
of fortune. Pidge had seen Fanny but once in the
meantime, but had asked her to write or telephone in
case of need.</p>

<p>Pidge found the hall designated in the third floor
of a condemned building in Foley Street, and was
directed to a door through which came the sounds of
a crying child. Her knock was answered, and the caller
gradually realized through the shadows that she was
being grinned at. She smiled back, wondering if the
shoeless creature were Fanny’s sister or mother. She
wore no outer waist and a heavy plaid skirt that was
splashed with wash water. An infant shrank into
the hollow curve of her body, and another child sat
wailing on the wet floor behind.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d come, Musser.”</p>

<p>It was Fanny herself. Pidge had crossed the threshold
to look into eyes in which hate and hunger moved
in a narrow orbit; narrow like the wet spot on the
floor, in which the first-born played. Tired back,
draggled hair, merely a stretched and faded vestige
of a girl was Fanny Gallup now. Laugh and street
talk were gone for the time, at least; gone as Albert,
the barber, as much a myth as ever, so far as Pidge
was concerned, though the place hypothecated a male
parent. These three remaining seemed purposeless bits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
of life which a perverted scheme permitted to live on.</p>

<p>Pidge hated herself for becoming involved in the
complication. For the moment, she hated New York
that could not keep itself clean. No rent, no food, somebody
else’s washing in the tubs, and the rags of Fanny
and her children unwashed.</p>

<p>“... No, it ain’t no good to think of staying,
Musser, because they’re tearing the buildin’ down.”</p>

<p>“How much rent do you owe?”</p>

<p>“Five weeks. But it ain’t no good to pay that,
because I got to get out anyway. Gawd, Redhead,
you look like a doll in a window!”</p>

<p>“Is there any place around here where you can go?”</p>

<p>“It’s hard to get in with the two, and you’d have
to pay a month in advance,” Fanny said.</p>

<p>“How soon do you have to leave here?”</p>

<p>“Four days. That’s why I sent the letter.”</p>

<p>“Have you got any—anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“That’s why I sent the letter. That’s why they keep
squalling all the time.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be back before dark,” Pidge said, turning into
the hall.</p>

<p>“You’ll—sure—come—back?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” called Pidge.</p>

<p>She returned with her arms full of groceries, and
went home promising to come back the next afternoon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“... Bring them here. There is no other way,”
Miss Claes said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“But they’re not clean!” Pidge moaned. “They are
too sick to keep clean.”</p>

<p>“We can freshen them up a little,” said Miss Claes.</p>

<p>“But there’s nothing Fanny can do, unless the two
children are taken from her. I mean she’s held to the
room with them now, and they’ve been crying so long
that they can’t stop. They both cry at once, and she
doesn’t hear them; they look and listen for a second
and then go on crying. If one stops, he hears the
other. The place smelled like a sty, and the packages
of food I brought got wet and spoiled before they
were opened.”</p>

<p>“Forget about them until to-morrow, Pidge, and
then get a taxicab and bring them here. I’ve got a
second-floor room toward the back.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVIII<br />

<small>AN OUTER CHANGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MISS CLAES standing by the table in her
own room heard a step upon an upper stairway;
not on the immediate basement stairs,
but of one descending from the second to the first
landing. The tread was deliberate. She heard it now
in the hall directly above. Miss Claes moved to the
door, her hand against her cheek; then back to stand
by the table again. Now the step was on the basement
stairs. A fire was burning in her grate, and that was
the main light of the room, for the winter morning was
very gray. The table was prepared for one—plate and
cup of ruddy gold, a cutting of white hyacinth in a
purple vase. The footsteps approached in the basement
hall; a heavy bag was placed down outside Miss Claes’
door; then Nagar appeared, a dark hat and an overcoat
upon his arm. He came forward, and the two stood
together for a moment.</p>

<p>“At least this once, I can serve you,” Miss Claes
said.</p>

<p>Nagar smiled as he sat down to the table. Miss Claes
went into the kitchen and presently brought a pot
of tea in a Chinese basket and a covered dish. She
filled a goblet from the water bottle, and stood behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
his chair while Nagar ate. The house was strangely
silent.</p>

<p>Nagar arose. They stood together again for a
moment by the mantel. He spoke in Hindi, and she
listened, like one already weary, hearing of more things
to do. Not until she smiled, did he turn away. She
did not follow to the door, nor look toward the window,
as he passed up the steps to the street. After a long
time, she stepped to the cabinet for a cigarette and lit
it standing by the fireplace.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIX<br />

<small>FANNY DRIES HER TEARS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FANNY GALLUP was taking life easy. She
had not been separated from her children, but
relieved for the present from the hunger drive
to support them. Pidge helped to pay Fanny’s room
and board, but didn’t miss the fact that the main expense
fell upon Miss Claes.</p>

<p>“There is a little fund back of me for just such
cases, Pidge,” Miss Claes said. “I rarely divulge the
fact, but there is no reason in the world why you should
be inconvenienced.”</p>

<p>“Except that I brought her here——”</p>

<p>“I asked you to.”</p>

<p>“Except that she called on <i>me</i> in her trouble, and
I worked elbow to elbow with her for four months,
and she pulls out the very devil from me every time
I see her.”</p>

<p>“Your feeling of responsibility is what makes you
what you are—I never miss that, Pidge. If you weren’t
so hard and straight on all the tricky little matters of
dollars and cents, you can be very sure I’d never tell
you my secret of secrets, about the fund.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to pay what I can, if only because I hate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
to so. But I can never pay for bringing her to your
house.”</p>

<p>Miss Claes laughed. “That is only the way you see
it. Fanny isn’t heavy on us here. Not at all. It’s the
dear, possessive Pidge that is hurt. Do you suppose
I am torn by what goes on in the rooms and halls? Not
torn beyond repair from day to day, at least. Fanny’s
only a little more simple than most, a little less secretive.”</p>

<p>“She’s unmoral,” Pidge declared solemnly. “The
awful thing is, she doesn’t learn. Life passes through
her like a sieve, leaves its muck on her, and she doesn’t
learn.”</p>

<p>Philosophy seldom helped Pidge; she had heard too
much of it, and money was invariably a serious affair.
In the California life there had never been enough
money for all needs. Adolph Musser was unable to do
without what he wanted, even though the immediate
tradespeople of the neighborhood were frequently
forced to. The metaphysician relied upon the Law of
Providence to take care of them; and this had hacked
and hewed into Pidge’s disposition; this had meant
red war to her soul up to the last hour in her father’s
house.</p>

<p>Here in New York the fight had been different.
Even with Miss Claes mysteriously back of her from
the beginning, she had faced, in her first few months
in New York, the ugly candor of starvation. There was
established in Pidge both from Los Angeles and New
York experiences, a determination to fix herself unrockingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
on her own feet in a financial way; and now,
just as she might have gotten a bit ahead, was the
expense of Albert’s children, and the claims of their
mother, which were getting to look as interminable
to Pidge as a ninety-nine years’ lease.</p>

<p>Another trouble was that Fanny was beginning to
show fresh traces of her sense of the “fun of the thing.”
Her spine was stiffening a little with good food and rest,
and curious little suggestions of starch showed in lips
and hair and breast that had been utterly draggled.
She was often seen hanging over the banisters; sure
indication of renewal of life and hope. She didn’t weep
over the departed Albert; in fact, Pidge Musser observed,
as an added revelation of the hatefulness of
life, that Fanny was back on the scene looking for a man—not
earnestly, not passionately, but without compunction
and entirely unwhipped. Fanny granted that she
was nobody, that she never had been; but that was no
sign why she should pass up anything that was going
by. Pain and hunger were forgotten like a sickness.</p>

<p>One night as she was coming in, Pidge heard Fanny’s
low laugh on the floor above, as she ran upstairs in
time to shoo a lodger from Fanny’s arms in the doorway.
Then she followed into the littered room and
a light was made. The two women faced. The laugh
remained unwithered on Fanny’s cheerful face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Musser, you look so cross,” she panted.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember—?” Pidge began.</p>

<p>“Remember wot?”</p>

<p>“What you were in that beast’s nest in Foley Street?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“That’s what you always want, Musser, always want
me to keep rememberin’, just as I’m getting straightened
out.”</p>

<p>The fashion of Fanny’s straightening out settled
upon Pidge, as she looked around the room. Its awfulness
was beyond tears to her, even beyond laughter.</p>

<p>“Fanny Gallup, if you bring another baby here,
I’ll—I’ll——”</p>

<p>“There ain’t going to be no other baby here, Musser.
I ain’t nobody’s chicken like that.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XX<br />

<small>THEY WALK IN CIRCLES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day just as Pidge was finishing luncheon
with John Higgins, she was startled to hear
Melton’s voice. He moved around their table
with a fling of his coat tails and held out both his hands.
It actually sounded, though she never was sure, as if he
said something like, “I’ve been looking everywhere for
you.”</p>

<p>Pidge fancied a sort of rueful wonder on the old
editor’s face, as he announced his haste to get back
to the office, and bolted out.... She was recalling
the baby carriage in Santa Monica. Melton’s face was
slightly broader, she thought, and the poise of young
success was upon it. One thing she had never known
before was how remarkably well his curly head was
placed upon its shoulders. The neck was not merely
a nexus, but a thing of worth in itself, with arch and
movement which made him look taller and intimated
something light and fleet, touching memories which
Pidge could not quite grip.</p>

<p>They were together in the street. Melton had asked
her to walk with him to his bank. He seemed on both
sides of her at once, his hand drawing her deftly this
way and that through the crowd, his chat and laughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
in her ears, and an old indescribable weariness and helplessness
in herself.</p>

<p>“... Sure, I could have hunted you up. In fact,
I would have done it eventually, but I haven’t been in
New York all the time; running back west to get my
stuff up, now and then.”</p>

<p>“I thought you lived in New York,” Pidge said.</p>

<p>“I keep an apartment in East Twenty-fourth Street,”
he granted.</p>

<p>A lull for just an instant before he went on:</p>

<p>“You see, it’s handy to my publishers, and my bank
is only a square or two away.”</p>

<p>Pidge wished she could accept him for just what
he seemed—the upstart American in literature. She
wished to forget everything else, save the youth who
said, in effect, “This is my bank, this is my solicitor,
this is my publisher.” But she could not smile her
scorn and pass on. She felt like the parent of a child
showing off. Back of the tinkle and flush of these big
days of his, which he seemed to be drinking in so
breathlessly, she felt more than ever that thing about
him which was imprisoned. A thing it was that called
to her, kept calling beseechingly.</p>

<p>“I’ll never forget,” he said, speaking of the fifty
dollars—“I’ll never forget that night, when I left you—and
the fog in the Square. Everything was different,
after that.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t go to Cleveland that night, as you said,”
she declared, watching the curve of his black lashes.</p>

<p>The eyes darted her way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Lucky, I didn’t,” he said. “God! How I wanted
to! New York had me bluffed that night, before you
came to the rescue.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you go?”</p>

<p>“I was up close to Grand Central with my bag, when
the idea struck me—the idea that has since come out in
the story series that has caught on. I could hardly
realize that I had your money. I kept it in my hand—the
hand in my pocket. That was a turning point in
a life. New York had frightened me pretty nearly
to death—the hunger thing, you know. All I wanted
on earth was to crawl into that train for Cleveland,
but it was as if you were calling on me to stay.”</p>

<p>She turned in pain and amazement. He was looking
straight ahead and talking softly. She saw every twist
and drive of his mind as he dramatized the situation
unfolding to him. He was deeply absorbed in the pictures
which his fertile brain uncovered one by one.
It hurt her like the uncovering of something perverted
in herself.</p>

<p>“Don’t go on like that,” she said. “You’re not
working now. You are just walking in the street.
You mustn’t make stories when you talk.”</p>

<p>He glanced at her sorrowfully, as one realizing in
himself a truth so big that he is willing to wait for it
to be believed.</p>

<p>“It is God’s truth,” he said. “That was the turning
point in my career—that night—the night I turned back
from the train. It was as if you were calling me, and
it was as if the idea came from you. I knew I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
to stay on and do the work here, close to the markets.”</p>

<p>She looked into his face and laughed.</p>

<p>“And you could forget me—forget the fifty dollars
for nearly a year!”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you for talking that way. I expect
to be misunderstood—not me, but the thing I stand
for.”</p>

<p>She was hushed. Could he mean that he suffered
in conscious conflict? Could it be that he was aware
at all of that imprisoned thing she saw back of his eyes?
He had halted, and now she turned again for him to
go on.</p>

<p>“I hoped that you, you of all, might understand,”
he said. “Why, it was from you that the whole thing
started.”</p>

<p>He seemed actually to be making himself believe
it. She felt herself trying to give him the benefit
of the doubt.</p>

<p>“Do you know you’re changed?” he said, in sudden
exultation. “Do you know you’re five times as charming?
What’s happened?”</p>

<p>“Nothing has happened,” said Pidge.</p>

<p>“It was the strangest shock, in the restaurant when
I saw you. I knew it was you, and yet you’ve put on
something—out of the ordinary.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t.... I must go back to the office now.”</p>

<p>“The bank is just half a block. We’ve been walking
in circles. I hadn’t a check in my pocket.... I wanted
to walk with you anyway. Do you really have to get
back to the office?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you—couldn’t we go down on the river
or to a show somewhere? I know what you’re thinking:
that if this meant so much to me, how could I
let it go for nearly a year. But you’ll understand.
You’ll see what I mean and what I’m up against. The
thing was too big for me to rush in. I had to wait.
But now that you’ve come, I can’t let you go.”</p>

<p>“I must go back.”</p>

<p>“To-night then. Couldn’t I meet you at <i>The Public
Square</i> at five and have supper?”</p>

<p>“Oh no. I must go home—first.”</p>

<p>“May I call for you at Harrow Street, say at seven,
or before that? Say, couldn’t we go to that old restaurant
where we went that night?”</p>

<p>This idea had come to Pidge before he spoke; exactly,
perhaps, as it caught his fancy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I could——” Pidge cleared her voice, and
spoke again above the roar of the street. “Yes, I
could.”</p>

<p>Then because she had lifted her voice, she seemed
to hear her own tones unforgetably, as if her soul
echoed back the words.</p>

<p>“But I must hurry back now,” she added.</p>

<p>“Let’s get this bank thing finished.”</p>

<p>But when they reached the door of the bank they
found it closed for the rest of the day.</p>

<small>THE DINNER COAT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JOHN HIGGINS came up through the newspapers
and magazine editorial rooms in those brave days
when a typewriter did not always go with a man’s
desk, but a cuspidor nearly always. Even yet, the editor
of <i>The Public Square</i> tucked a piece of fine-cut between
his cheek and lower jaw after breakfast in the
morning, and forgot about it just so long as it was
there. The fact that he smoked from time to time
caused no inconvenience to the wad of shredded leaf.
He complained of indigestion and gave himself wholeheartedly
to various forms of diet.</p>

<p>He kept Pidge Musser close at hand during these
trying war days. His former stenographer languished.
John Higgins found a singular peace in working with
Pidge and was innocent enough to discuss it. He was
an old integer so far as women were concerned, never
getting beyond the rare confession (when a few drinks
ripened his mind) that he had had a mother once. He
didn’t hate women; nothing like that. He had just
merely walked around them as you walk around the
shore of an ocean. He wasn’t born with a bathing suit
and the idea of taking off his shoes and stockings made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
him hoarse with fright. Pidge, however, had crept in
through the business door, and John Higgins awoke to
find her at his side.</p>

<p>Pidge found him like a somber relative of the elder
generation, when she returned from her hectic walk
with Melton that afternoon, but for once she could forget
John Higgins easily. Twenty times in her mind,
at least, Pidge went over the talk and walk with Melton,
her face often turned away to the window with a sad
but scornful smile. She thought it out with hard sophistication,
all that he had said of receiving inspiration
from her, but underneath she wanted it to be so; and
deep among the secrets of herself, she felt that what he
said was possibly truer than he knew.</p>

<p>Had he known that the bank would be closed? She
would soon learn about that, for he had promised to
bring the check to-night. Even if he didn’t, she could
never forget that <i>calling</i> to her, back of his actor eyes—calling
like a child of her own. New York whirled by
below; the manuscripts were piled high in front and
side. A Mecca letter came in from Richard Cobden,
intimating that he might go to India. Even that did
not arouse John Higgins, nor startle Pidge Musser
from the painful web she was in.</p>

<p>Melton was at the basement entrance at seven. As
Pidge went down to meet him, Fanny Gallup was
coming up. They met in the second hall. Fanny stood
in the gaslight, her arms open wide, her dress open at
the breast, her eyes laughing.</p>

<p>“I saw him, Redhead. He’s a God-awful, that boy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Don’t you bring no little baby to this house! I won’t
stand for it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Melton wore a black cape coat, a dinner coat beneath.
Pidge felt as if she had left all her light in the second
hall. She was exasperated with herself for pushing
past Fanny and not taking the joke gracefully, exasperated
with Melton for togging up to come to Harrow
Street, to take her to that old eating house. Couldn’t
he resist showing off for just one hour?</p>

<p>Some awe seemed to have fallen upon him, or rather
between them. In silence they rounded the almost empty
curve of Harrow Street, and presently entered the
crowds and lights and crashes of trestled Sixth Avenue.
On the corner, as they crossed Eighth Street, Pidge
heard a newsboy behind say, “There goes a movie
actor.” Pidge deeply knew what that grimed child-face
had seen.... It troubled Melton to find the restaurant,
and she didn’t help, though she had located it a score
of times since that other night. At the table, while they
waited, he took a fifty-dollar check from his pocket and
handed it over, saying that the real part of the favor he
would try to pay bit by bit through the years.</p>

<p>“Because I’ll never get very far from you again,”
he added queerly. “Find it very funny, don’t you? Sit
there chuckling, don’t you? You can laugh, but it’s
true.”</p>

<p>Now Melton began to ask for things which weren’t
on the bill-of-fare. He told the waitress how things
should be prepared and served—this in a side-street eating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
house, that specialized in beans and encouraged
counter trade. There were hard lines around the mouth
of the waitress which Melton commented upon, as she
turned her back. Pidge had a warning to hold her
temper, and yet she would have died first.</p>

<p>“I’ve never worked in a restaurant,” she said, “but
I’ve worked in a factory, and I know what those lines
come from. They come from dealing with people like
you, people who forget where they are, forget what they
come for.”</p>

<p>“How do I forget where I am?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Because you don’t know that this is a place where
they serve ‘eats.’ ‘Eats’ are cooked all one way. ‘Eats’
are served fast in business hours, and the waiters sit
around and gasp the other times, trying to catch up with
themselves. And you don’t know where you are, because
you try to show these people and me that you’ve
seen how it was done in uptown hotels.”</p>

<p>A trace of sullenness showed in his eyes, and then
a warmth of almost incredible delight.</p>

<p>“It’s great! I never was scolded in my life!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t for supper alone—that wasn’t why I fell
into the idea of coming here,” she said. “You forget
it entirely. You dare to come in a dress suit—here—here!”</p>

<p>“Listen,” he begged, “don’t run away with that idea.
I thought we might go to a theater afterward. I didn’t
think so much about where we were going as I did that
I was coming to you. I didn’t have anything better
than this to put on, and so I came this way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>A moment before it had seemed the most righteous
and perfect thing under heaven to vent a few scathing
remarks, but now she felt twisted and diminished. Long
and religiously she had tried to keep her rages to herself.
Neither spoke while the plates were being served, and
then he said:</p>

<p>“I was horribly out of true, in telling these people
how to do it, but I wanted it good for you,” he added
simply.</p>

<p>She looked at him hard, but the intensity of her trying
that instant kept her from reading what was really
back of his eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s plenty good enough for me,” she said. “I came
here once when I had only twenty cents to live on that
day—I remember the stool, that fifth stool, I sat on.
I spent my twenty cents all at once,” she added, “and
the grub was so good that I could have wept in the arms
of the woman on the other side of the counter.”</p>

<p>“Was that when you were working in the factory?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said Pidge, “it was before I got the job. I ate
regularly after that.”</p>

<p>“Where was the factory?”</p>

<p>“Oh, way up in the other end of town. I labeled tins,
salmon tins, baking powder tins, cocoa tins.”</p>

<p>“To get local color?” he asked.</p>

<p>“To get food. I sat at a big table with a lot of girls,
and in the hours and hours, in the monotony of the
days, I found out how easy it is to get hard lines around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the mouth. I learned to understand just enough to learn
that I know nothing, and that’s a lot.”</p>

<p>She was thinking of what a tension she had been in
to escape from Fanny Gallup.</p>

<p>“I worked on a ranch in Wyoming,” Melton observed,
“cattle ranch.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing on the Tunisian sands?”</p>

<p>“Just ramming around the world. I got in bad with
an Arab sheik. It was while running away from him
that I got lost in the desert.”</p>

<p>She saw his eyes kindle in the prospect of narration,
his faculties forming a fresh tale, which she could not
bear to hear that moment. She forestalled his fruitfulness.</p>

<p>They were in the streets.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to go uptown,” said Pidge. “I
don’t feel like the theater to-night——”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like a ride on the harbor? The ferries
are empty this time of night.”</p>

<p>“No, we’ll cross over to Harrow Street.”</p>

<p>“May I come in? There’s so much to say. It’s just—finding
you again—Pan.”</p>

<p>“Not to-night. I want to be alone.”</p>

<p>He didn’t answer. She felt a little better after that.
She had thought it might be harder to have her way.
There seemed always something he could not say behind
his words. It wasn’t <i>all</i> lies. It became clear for a
moment that he would follow after her—so long as she
could run ahead; that he would only turn away and
forget when she paused to breathe or play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“I feel strange,” he said in the silence of Harrow
Street. “It is strange to-night. It’s like finding the
house one has been looking for so long—the house, even
the door, but not the key. Pan,” he said suddenly,
“give it to me. Give me the key. It’s you—it’s
yours——”</p>

<p>His strength was without strain, the strength that is
effortless, the strength of laughter. He had taken her
to him suddenly, and she dwelt in it, though resisting;
something ecstatic, even in holding out.... She heard
voices in herself and faces flashed through her mind—Cobden’s,
Fanny Gallup’s—but her arms and shoulders
and breast knew a terrible sweetness from his strength.
It wasn’t hateful. It was like her own boy, not a
stranger. His laughing face was nearer. It was coming
to hers. In the dark she could see it, eyes and eyelids,
curving nostrils and laughing lips. She knew
something would die in her when it touched ... that
she was dying now of the slowness of its coming. She
ceased to struggle, and all that she had known and been
arose within her to meet his lips.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She was on the second flight of stairs. She almost
prayed that Fanny’s door would not open. She wanted
to be in her own little room, the smaller the better to-night—no
touch or voice upon her. The key turned in
her trembling hand. She was safe, the door locked
again. She stood in the dark. Her lips moved audibly:</p>

<p>“Am I—is it because I am my father’s child?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXII<br />

<small>A LETTER FROM PIDGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">RICHARD COBDEN moved up and down the
Near East for a long time, looking for the
men they had told him about in school and
college—the men who make history, and are said to contain
in themselves the greatness of their race. He sailed
with sailors, talked with the diploma-ed talkers, rode
with soldiers. He found men who would do for their
countries what they wouldn’t do for themselves, but the
energy of their fidelity to their countries was balanced
by their enmity toward other countries. They gave
themselves to the heresy of fighting one part of the
human family for the alleged enhancement of another.
It took Dicky a long time to change the brain tracks
made in school and college, that the names of history
might <i>not</i> be the names of men who walked with God,
whose intellects pained from sheer power. Nor was he
spared from the suspicion in all his discoveries, that he
was the one who was wrong, that he had become softly
insane in the midst of new ideas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he essayed the thing Miss Claes spoke of at
the Punjabi dinner—he started something which he
meant to live up to. The fact that it was harder than he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
dreamed; an effort, in fact, involving dreary years,
hadn’t broken his resolution so far. One of the terms
of the Punjabi dinner covenant, for such it had become
to him, was not to lose himself in the easy way of
hatred, nor to help himself to forgetfulness by casting
Pidge Musser’s image out. He knew that the “one”
she had spoken of was Rufus Melton. Through months,
covering two years, the figure of this young story-writer
rose higher and higher in his consciousness, as the person
of the Enemy, himself. It was Melton, all unknowing,
who vanquished Dicky in his weaknesses, and at
best was only kept at bay in his strength. Not to cast
her out, not to hate; to know the slow, steady burning
of the heart that is focalized upon a woman, and to
realize that this woman may be turning to another!</p>

<p>There were really extraordinary days of service in
Arabia with young Tom Lawrence, whose fame Dicky
Cobden helped to make; desert days of camel back and
Turk fighting; desert nights of smoke and tea in such
starry stillnesses, that one almost expected the Christ
to appear; then, after many weeks, mail at Mecca, and
one letter from John Higgins, which was read several
times:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... You have done several good things for <i>The
Public Square</i>; but you never did a better thing than
wishing Miss Pidge Musser on our editorial rooms.
She’s brand new every morning. She’s honest, and a
worker. She has brains and a whole lot of psychic
viscera, sometimes designated as Soul.... Also she’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
a stenographer. Never whispered it until one morning
when Maneatin’ Dollie was ill with the flu. My letters
were piled up. “Give them to me,” she said. I did that
thing, and I’ve been dictating my editorials ever since.
It’s like talking to an intelligent audience. When I get
opinionated and lose my balance, not seeing the other
side of a question, this child sits up and looks disturbed....
I’m sending you separately our Brooklyn Bridge
contemporary with a story called <i>The Salt Pit</i>. If it
isn’t a little man of a story—I don’t know one. Hers....
Of course, you know why she didn’t give it to us.
She thought I’d take it on her account and not for the
story.... And still we stay out of the War. They’re
sending over one big imperialist after another from
London, trying to get us in, and all that’s flunkey in
Washington, rocks—but so far, we’re only sinning commercially....
Give us more of the inky desert nights,
Dicky, and young Lawrence.</p>
</div>

<p>Dicky reached Bombay from Aden in the spring of
1917. He was now on his way home, the long way
around. He had told no one, but it had grown upon
him of late that he could relish a bit of New York after
more than two years. He coldly ignored in himself the
tendency to thrill at the thought of seeing Pidge Musser
again. He had made a bit of a name for himself as a
reporter, but was known more as a first-class fact-getter
than a feature writer among newspaper men.
Facts were sometimes so bleak in his work that one had
to possess real understanding and real love for honest
materials to find the inherent beauty and order. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
knowledge of international politics was now granted by
all classes of newspaper men, but he was known especially
from his articles in <i>The Public Square</i> as one who
exerted a steady pressure against America entering the
war.</p>

<p>To be cool was said to be Cobden’s religion. The
stuff that he wrote was cool and the words that he said.
“I am a reporter, only,” he occasionally explained. “I
write what I see, not my own reactions nor opinions.”
He had come far in this doctrine, far enough to be
trusted by white men of place in Turkey and the Holy
Land, in spite of his curious scorn for war. He was
somewhat slower now to get enthused over human actions
than he was when he left New York; his boyish
humor had become grim. He had seen the worst things
men do, and written a few of them. Though he had
been through as much hard riding in two years as any
empire-building Englishman, he seemed to retain no
personal relation to his adventures.</p>

<p>Other men talked about him, however. There was
something about the American that made it easy for
others to “sketch at him.” Tales of his far chances
with Tom Lawrence in El Hejas, for instance, had followed
him up into Turkey, but no one knew his tendency
to nausea in a pinch.</p>

<p>Dicky had written a lot of big newspaper stories, but
they were stories of the day. He had packed the films
of tense and frightening and humorous moments away
somewhere deep in his brain, to the end of massing
them all into one—one day doing the Big Story, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
had to do with finding a Man. That dream had held
since the day he first saw Nagar. But in his heart of
hearts everything was a side issue—world politics,
world wars, newspaper stories, magazine stories, even
the Big Story of all—compared to the war in himself
over a girl named Pidge. He still had night sweats
over the name of Rufus Melton.... A quiet voice,
a tired smile, a face darkened and dusty looking from
exposure, even after a clean shave—out of this face,
usually shadowed by a big cake-basket helmet of cork,
shone a pair of steady eyes in a fine mesh of dusty
brown wrinkles—Dicky at twenty-eight.</p>

<p>He had scarcely stepped ashore at Bombay when he
heard that the States had entered the war. He touched
the sleeve of an Englishman who was looking up at the
promenade deck of the ship with eyes and mouth wide
open.</p>

<p>“Tell me, I hadn’t heard,” Dicky said hoarsely.</p>

<p>“She’s in, but I must say, sir, she took a long time
about it.”</p>

<p>“But that cannot be!” Dicky answered.</p>

<p>Now the Englishman stared, this being the peerless
rebuke. Moreover, he observed that the American had
a sudden withered look, and presumed that he was a
mere upstart person. Accordingly, the Englishman refixed
his triple focus on the ship’s promenade deck, and
Cobden tunneled into the bus for the <i>King George</i>.
There he verified the news. He went to his room a bit
whipped, quite a little bit whipped. He wanted to be
alone. For two years he had written and felt for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
America as only an exile can. He had believed in her
luck and native horse sense in the midst of the mess
other countries were making of their national lives.</p>

<p>Something snapped when he had been alone in his
room for a while. It was Dicky’s romantic allegiance
to the country of his school histories. For the present
he was a man without national gravity, and a sick man
since some hot, hard-held part of himself had been
ripped out.</p>

<p>He had missed his mail in Aden and left word for it
to be forwarded to Bombay on the next steamer. A
cablegram from his newspaper connection, rewired from
Aden, not only counseled him to make haste to double
back to France (to be on the spot to greet the first
American military arrivals), but accepted it as settled
that there was nothing else for a man of his equipment
now to do. The message was actually elate with the
“doings” ahead, but Dicky Cobden didn’t see it that
way. The fact is, he was sore, personally sore, at what
had happened and didn’t care who knew it. The following
ship brought his mail, including a letter from Pidge
Musser, which he opened with an old and ugly fear,
and in this letter the worst that he had ever feared fell
upon him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Oh, Dicky, there is no other way. I’ve tried
to dodge it, but it has to be told now, that I have taken
Rufus Melton. Why did I do it? I don’t know, unless
it is that I am evil and unfinished and answer to the evil
and unfinished in him. He draws me terribly, but at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
the same time, I am not deluded. There is never a
moment with him that is not unmixed with pain....
I wonder if you can believe that I did not do this thing
for happiness; that the happiest moments I have ever
known have come from my work with John Higgins
and my friendship with you? And can you ever believe
that I am no farther from you now, in that mysterious
comrade way?... Oh, Life is not like books, Dicky,
not at all like what we are taught it is. I have a relation
to him. I answer some terrible drawing need—like a
child crying for me. But I have a relation to you, too,
only different. You mean rest, something done. He
means the unfinished. He brings a mirror to me, and
says, “Look!” I want to scream, because the mirror
brings out all my defects. That’s what his presence
means.... This is one true thing, Dicky. The one
who can rouse the most hell in your breast is the one
to whom you belong for the time. At least, that is true
to me.... Have I not been grateful for your stability?
And have I not been proud for your moving so quietly
up and down the East, keeping your surfaces clean for
the world events to be pictured there without twist or
falsehood?... A strange door was opened in my
being when I was a child. In and out that door, whether
I will or not, you often come and go. “He is my
friend,” I whisper, “my friend”——and repeat it a
thousand times.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIII<br />

<small>THE RED ROOM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LINE by line the thing was killing him. He got
up and crossed the heavy red carpet to the hall
door and turned the key in the lock. He was
afraid some one would come in and find him. He had
the strange power of partly seeing himself, as the sullen
horrors of hatred and revolt boiled up in his breast.
Vaguely, but quite well enough, he could watch the man
called Richard Cobden in the dim hotel room, the
shoulders hunched, the mouth stretched and crooked;
unable to sit still, the face wet with poisonous sweat.</p>

<p>The love had gone out of him, and with it, all the
light he had. He thought he had known pain and loneliness
since leaving New York, but all he had known
was humming content compared to now, because there
had been a laughing idolatry for all her ways and
words, a reliance upon her that he had dared to call
absolute. “Understand, understand!” she had cried
all through the letter.... Oh yes, he could understand.
She wasn’t what he had made her out to be—that
was clear enough. He had built upon something
which wasn’t there. He had believed her to be—built
into himself the conviction—that she was the honestest
thing alive, and here she was——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>His thought shot back to the night of the Punjabi
dinner. That little basement room was devastated
before his mind, the table overturned, the face of Miss
Claes a mockery, the face of Pidge Musser—that of
an American girl found out. Into the center of his
consciousness was now flung his old promise not to hate....
He heard his own laughter. He saw his own
stretched and twisted mouth from which it came. Like
a couple of sly schoolgirls, they looked at him now—Pidge
and Miss Claes—slyly pulling together and
duping a fat boy....</p>

<p>He saw his room key upon the table. Number Five,
it was, the fifth floor. He looked around the dim
papered wall—whitish-red like the pulp of raspberries—the
deep upholstered chairs, the seats slightly crushed,
the full-length mirror, the ash tray, the silver flask on
the writing table, his own things here and there orderly
enough—all but himself, a sort of maniacal Mr. Hyde.
Number Five. He would remember this room where
he had fought it out, too, about America entering the
war. He poured brandy into a whisky glass. The
stuff eased him a little. It made the pain all the more
poignant, like a stove getting hotter, but also it seemed
to give him the power to move back a little from the
stove.... He stood up in the dark and shook himself.</p>

<p>“Oh, you ass!” he muttered. “You awful ass!”</p>

<p>In the light of a match, as he lit a cigarette long afterward,
he saw the rest of his mail on the table, one letter
from Miss Claes. He couldn’t get head nor tail out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
that at first. She seemed to be talking about something
he had said about finding a Man. Oh, yes. He had
written from Mecca, mentioning Tom Lawrence and his
search for a Man. He snickered now at himself
through the fogs of his own past and present. Then
a line seemed to stand up before his eyes. “... If
you go to India, go to Ahmedabad. Nagar is there.
You are in danger of finding your Man.” Later that
night, still in the dark, his back straightened. He
laughed and said aloud, failing altogether for the moment
to see the absurdity of himself.</p>

<p>“Number Five—queer little old musty room, I wonder
who died here?... Good night, Pidge; good
night, dear America—grand pair to tie to!”</p>

<p>The next day he cabled to his newspaper connection
that he was not returning to France for the opening
campaign, at least; and wrote to John Higgins that
he didn’t expect to send in much stuff for the present.
“I may stay awhile in India—just looking around.
She smells like a typhoid ward, and needs orderlies....
I’ll, of course, let you know what comes of my
<i>spectating</i>.”</p>

<p>Still he did not start at once for Ahmedabad. He
locked himself in Number Five through the days and
walked the streets of Bombay at night, walked like a
man in a strait-jacket. He wasn’t conscious of this
at first, until he began to feel an ache from the tension
of his neck and shoulder muscles and tightened elbows.
When he forced himself to relax, however, the torture
of his thoughts was accentuated. He had been holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
himself rigidly to help fend off the destroying rush
of mental images. He walked himself into one sweat
after another for the nights were hot and humid. The
point of all his fighting was to keep Pidge Musser out
of mind. Of course, he could not succeed. She came
in by every door. She came in softly, she came in
scornfully, she came in singing, scolding. Mostly she
came in saying, “Why, don’t you see, Dicky, I am
nearer and clearer than ever?” Then it was as if an
isolated bit of shrapnel would explode in his brain.</p>

<p>His whole fabric of world politics was demolished.
It looked to him like a tapestry that has been hooked
up out of a sewer—all that careful weaving and balanced
pigmentation! Before the day of the letter he
had prided himself that his building in the past two
years was good and strong. Now he faced the pitiful
discovery that every block of his building had been
placed upon this platform: That even if he couldn’t
have her, no one else could. This smelled to him now.
Forever after, it smelled to him like the sewage lanes
of old Bombay.</p>

<p>Dicky had a good body. After two weeks his physical
vitality began to steal back. The love was gone,
but out of the debris of Subramini’s Punjabi Fireplace,
the face of Miss Claes came up faintly smiling again.
Another letter came from her, which he read in dismal
irony several times on the day before he took the train
for Ahmedabad—the last day in Number Five, with
its wall paper of raspberry crush. He couldn’t make
sense out of the letter. She seemed to love Pidge, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
to respect her. Miss Claes wrote, “It gives me quiet
joy to know that Nagar is near you. It will be good
for him and good for you. A great dearness for you
both goes from this house, as you sit and walk together.”
Miss Claes also repeated in her letter that
“love never faileth”——</p>

<p>All very pretty and possible, no doubt; it sounded
good, but it was no longer his sort of a project. This
wasn’t for the product of three generations of
hardware merchants and manufacturers. Funny, he
thought, how he had ever accepted visionary stuff like
this. He would write Miss Claes some time how he
had failed, but not now. On the night train, he felt
India closing about him really for the first time. Once
when the train stopped, he smelled the altogether indescribable
earthiness of hills that had been sun baked
all day, now letting it be known through the moistness
of the night. It was vaguely like home to him; not
home in America, but home on earth again, the faintest
symptom of his reallegiance to life here, only known
to one coming up out of sickness. In the early morning
he lay for a while after awakening in a sort of
bodily peace. It was as if he had really rested a little,
as if he had left behind some utterly miserable part of
himself in the red room at Bombay.</p>

<p>“A bit questionable,” he muttered whimsically, with
the trace of a smile, “a bit shabby and questionable to
leave a bundle, a black bundle like that, in Number Five—for
some one else to stumble over.”</p>

<p>He fell asleep again and reawoke with a curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
sentence on his lips; something that he had forgotten
a long time, something that Miss Claes used to say:
“Nobody knows Nagar—nobody.”</p>

<p>“Nobody ever will,” he added, “if he doesn’t talk
any more than he used to.”</p>

<p>Again at breakfast the faintest little quiver of organic
ease stole into him. The earth was very bright
outside and the pot of tea that had been brought tasted
actually sane. He had the feeling of being on the
way somewhere, of having escaped something, as he
watched India slip by from the window of his compartment....
Then Ahmedabad, the station, a Hindu
in white garments, almost taking him in his arms—laughing,
talking like an American—Nagar talking!</p>

<small>MISS CLAES SPEAKS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE Sunday morning about three weeks after
the luncheon with John Higgins, during which
Rufus Melton came to the Chop House, Pidge
found Miss Claes alone in the basement front.</p>

<p>“We’d like to come here to live. Is there any
chance?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, it can be managed, I think.”</p>

<p>Pidge regarded her with a kind of cold fixity and
added: “We were married night before last. Rufe
seems willing enough to come here. I hate to leave
this house, but I didn’t think you had the rooms.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make a place for you; a little place, at least.
But, Pidge——”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you come to me all this time?”</p>

<p>“I know how fond you are of Dicky Cobden. I
haven’t hoped any one could understand.”</p>

<p>“Being fond of Richard Cobden doesn’t make me
less fond of you.”</p>

<p>“How could I expect you to understand me, when I
can’t understand myself?” Pidge demanded. “I am
two people, and they are at war.... No use lying
about it. I fell for him, knowing him all the time. Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
for a minute did I lose track of what he is. But I
wanted him. Something in me answered—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I’ve always loved that honest Pidge,” said Miss
Claes.</p>

<p>“Think, if you like, that it’s part of the evil in me
that talks this way about him, but I am talking about
myself, too.”</p>

<p>“You could never see all this clearly—without ‘falling
for’ him, Pidge.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean it would remain a hopeless, unfinished
puzzle—if you had run away from Rufus Melton.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t run away. I wanted him,” Pidge repeated.
“But there’s another side. There’s something
in him that I seem to have known from the beginning—something
like a little child that I left somewhere ages
ago. It keeps calling to me from his eyes, and I leave
everything to go to it—everything that Dicky means
and the world, even writing—I leave all that. And
yet when I go, when I go to his arms, I lose the purpose.
It’s as if the child that I run to—the irresistible
thing that calls to me from his eyes—stops crying and
stops needing me! Then I suddenly know that it must
need me and not be gratified, ever to be helped. Oh, no
one on earth could understand that. It’s insane.”</p>

<p>“But, Pidge, I do understand.”</p>

<p>“How can you?”</p>

<p>“Because I have loved like that, because I have had
experience. I loved an English boy in the same way—oh,
long ago. I love him still, but I could not stay with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
him, because he—why, Pidge, it is just the same. He
needs to cry for some one, for something, otherwise he
remains asleep in life.”</p>

<p>“You’re saying this to help me.”</p>

<p>“What I’ve lived through <i>should</i> help you. It was
the hardest thing I’ve ever known—that I couldn’t
forget everything and have him, just two alone in the
world. But when I went to him, he was satisfied and
looked elsewhere. I almost died of revolt.”</p>

<p>Pidge’s eyes were very wide. “And when you didn’t
go to him?” she said in slow tones. “What happened
then?”</p>

<p>“It was then that he remembered and reminded me
that I was half-caste. Also he looked elsewhere, just
the same.”</p>

<p>“And you still love him?”</p>

<p>“Deep underneath—that is not changed.”</p>

<p>“But what is Nagar?”</p>

<p>“Nagar means the other world, Pidge—a new heaven
and a new earth. He means the not-wanting love, the
willing-to-wait love——”</p>

<p>“I’m not like that,” Pidge said with old bitterness.
“I want love in a room! I want to shut the world out.
I don’t want the love of the world, but love that’s all
mine. And I can’t—I can’t have it!”</p>

<p>She was breathing deeply, staring at the fire.</p>

<p>Miss Claes glanced at her wistfully a moment, her
lips faintly smiling. The girl’s face had never been so
lovely to her. It was like land that has had its rains
after long waiting—soft blooms starting, an earthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
sweetness rising in the washed sunlight. The beginnings
of both laughter and tears were in Pidge’s wide
eyes; her red-brown hair, from which the henna was
long forgotten, had an easy restful gleam in its coils.</p>

<p>“Why, Pidge,” Miss Claes said at last, “you’re like
one who has been born again. It’s wonderful. I had
almost forgotten what that love does to a woman, at
first—for a little, little time.”</p>

<p>“And you knew that kind of love—with the English
boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And Nagar knows.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Pidge shivered.</p>

<p>“... Rufe brings the fight to me, makes every undone
thing rise and live! He brings the most terrible
disappointments, the crudest disorder, yet that which
would pay for it all, if I were just a simple peasant
woman, is denied. Why can’t we shut the door and
just live? Why can’t there be a kingdom for two?”</p>

<p>The form was soft and gliding in Miss Claes’ arms.
The square-shouldered little figure of the mill and office
girl had become almost eloquent with its emotional
power. After a moment Pidge straightened, her face
staring into Miss Claes’.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you answer?”</p>

<p>“I can only say, Pidge, you are called to learn the
next step, the next lesson in what love means. You
want the love that has two ends, but the Triangle is
ready for you. Oh, many are learning the mystery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
of the Triangle. It hurts so at first, but it lets the
world in—the bigger meanings of life.”</p>

<p>Pidge shivered again. “Is it blasphemy,” she asked,
“that I feel just as close to Dicky Cobden—as ever?”</p>

<p>“No more than the finding of bread would spoil
your taste for water.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pidge said at last:</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to leave this house, Miss Claes.
He says he’ll come here, too.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking of putting a bathroom on the
third floor. There’s a tiny empty room like yours
across the hall. The bath shall be installed there. You
know I’ve kept Nagar’s room empty. It is pleasant
and larger than yours. I’ll have a door cut through
the partition, and with a bath across the hall you will
do well enough for a time.”</p>

<p>“You would give us Nagar’s room?”</p>

<p>“Nagar has the key to the whole house,” said Miss
Claes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Moments afterward, Pidge’s strong fingers closed
over the hands of the other.</p>

<p>“No one can know how it hurts me—to think of
Dicky——”</p>

<p>“He is with Nagar now.”</p>

<p>“Do you think—can it be possible that Nagar will
help him—as you help me?”</p>

<p>“Nagar and the Little Man,” said Miss Claes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXV<br />

<small>“BE IT EVER SO HUMBLE”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THEY were ensconced in the two upper rooms.
Pidge kept up her work at <i>The Public Square</i>,
and did not come home for luncheon. She
had told John Higgins of her marriage but the subject
was not mentioned afterward. The old chief vanished
for three days following the news, and when he came
back there was a new dignity on his part for Pidge to
cope with. She found her position a trifle uncentered.
His old stenographer took his letters, and he wrote his
editorials on his own machine as aforetime. John Higgins
said little, but found flaws in her judgments that
had not appeared before. He no longer risked availing
himself of her entire equipment; this change being
apparently on the basis that he dare not get used to it
all over again. He seemed to hold the idea that it was
only a question of days at most before a married woman
would forget place and town entirely and rush off to
pick up pieces of wool and thread for a nest.</p>

<p>Pidge had built so much of herself into her work
that there was emphatic pain in the new conditions.
She needed the work more than ever now, but <i>The
Public Square</i> was falling into sorry days and ways.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
There was nothing to say but War, and if you didn’t
like War, didn’t see the divine uses of War and say so,
you had better say nothing. There was no field in the
world at this time for a magazine of dignified or any
other kind of protest, and in the steady loss of money
week after week, the struggle became one of great simplicity—to
stay alive.</p>

<p>“Higgins is a rotten old knocker anyway,” said
Rufus Melton. “This is a time for Americans to stand
together and not criticize the government. He never
did pay any real money for his stuff, but was always
ready to tell you where you fell down. They’re telling
him a word or two now.”</p>

<p>So Pidge didn’t speak much of <i>The Public Square</i>
at home.</p>

<p>Rufus vibrated between a depression when his stuff
wouldn’t come through and an exaltation when it did.
He was quite sincere in his industry, but slept late in
the morning. Pidge was up and away four mornings
out of five without waking him. Sometimes Rufe decided
to eat his “big meal of the day” in the middle of
the afternoon, in which case Pidge supped alone. He
was slow to get his work started, so that it was often
evening before he got “all of himself working at once.”
Then he was apt to stay with it for several hours, in
which case Pidge could sleep if she got a chance. Occasionally
he found that he could dictate a bit of first
draft and Pidge undertook at first to help him in this
way, but when she perceived that it didn’t occur to him,
in the flush of his evening powers, that she had worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
all day and must work to-morrow, she decided to stay
off his night work.</p>

<p>“I can’t, Rufe,” she said one night on the way to
bed. “It’s so fascinating to practice napping in the
hushes and rushes of your machine.”</p>

<p>“You won’t take this stuff?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You won’t?”</p>

<p>“It will interfere with your work session if you lose
your temper. Of course, we’ve got the whole upper
floor to start something in, but we must think of your
story.”</p>

<p>“Whose work counts in this outfit?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yours, Rufe, by all means. A fine patriotic short
story at any price. But I have a job to look after, and
I can’t give them a red-headed somnambulist to-morrow.
No, I’m going to sleep, but I do hope you get the
American flags waving all right in your story.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get you, Pan—for acting like this.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got me, dear, and don’t forget to have the
hero come through with, ‘My country right or wrong.’
No girl can resist that—or editor. Good night.”</p>

<p>Rufe was rarely rough. He didn’t overtire or over-stimulate
himself, so that his temper could easily break
corral; and at its worst this temper wasn’t a man-eater.
Rufe’s nervous system was cushioned in a fine layer of
healthy fat, and therefore didn’t flog itself to madness
against bare bone and sinew. He was merely involved
in himself entirely, which makes any man naïve.</p>

<p>Pidge wasn’t missing any of the petty dramas of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
present experience. When she came home the first
time to find that he had already had dinner, something
flew out of her into space in a frantic search for God.
When she realized that he saw nothing but undisturbed
equity in the idea of using her for his own work purposes
half the night, when she was contracted to <i>The
Public Square</i> for the days—another output of herself
was loose in the solar system. When she came to understand
that the tens he was earning were mysteriously
his own, and that her ones were theirs—another day, at
least, was spoiled for her in the editorial rooms.</p>

<p>Rufe thought her extremely selfish. So had her
father. “Two to one,” she said. “They’ve got it on
me. They’ve got it on all of us. This is their world.”...
She thought of all this bitterness and bickering
taking place in Nagar’s room, which Miss Claes had
saved for weeks for a sort of sanctuary of her own.
Mostly she was hurt by the deadly parallel of this life,
with her life in Los Angeles and vicinity. To cope
with this American story-man, she was forced to draw
out and readjust and refurbish the old hateful mechanism
that had formed within her during the nineteen
years with her father. She knew how. The mechanism
worked all right, but the sense of the hateful thing
resuming activity within her was far harder to bear
than the racket of Rufe’s typewriter when she was trying
to sleep.</p>

<p>The fact that Rufe Melton was entirely cut off from
the play of her real powers; that he thought her ridiculous,
and said so, when she gave any notice of holding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
other than the standard American points of view on
politics and religion and social ethics; this was not so
serious a breach between them, as it would have been
to a woman who had not come into so startling a reaction
as Pidge had, against the whole system of knowing
and not doing. All the knowledge that really mattered
to Pidge was that working doctrine which doesn’t announce
or explain, but shows itself in living the life.
She was very sad, and continually sad, that she had to
work upon Rufe the iron of irony, the stab so subtle
that it astonishes before it hurts, and the self-control
which disarms.</p>

<p>Sometimes Sundays or in unexpected periods of
leisure they had moments of actual delight together.
This occasionally happened when food just pleased him,
or when an acceptance from a magazine arrived at a
price which he considered adequate. (Rufus never
neglected the price of his things, as an indication of his
getting on.) He uncovered a real levity at such times,
and their talk didn’t walk merely, then; it danced.</p>

<p>“We’ll go up to Harlem,” he said one Sunday morning.
“I used to live up there in the colored settlement——”</p>

<p>Figuratively speaking, Pidge waved her hand before
her own eyes to shut out the critical negatives which
always arose when Rufe told of living somewhere.
They went and stayed gay. When he turned from her
innocently to consult a policeman in Harlem, she
checked the first and last, “I told you so.” They found
yams that day—yams freshly arrived from Georgia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
and coffee said to be parched and dripped according to
an ideal of New Orleans first families. These satisfied
Rufus, and still they stayed gay. Even his, “I
could take you around to a lot of queer dumps in this
man’s town,” didn’t upset anything. Altogether that
day was memorable.... Once in desperate fatigue,
when there were moving dark spots before her eyes in
every ray of daylight, Pidge cried to Miss Claes:</p>

<p>“But he is lost to everything, entirely oblivious to
everything but himself and his work—his stories, his
fame, his winning his way!”</p>

<p>“I know, Pidge, but the world is on top of him yet.
He is fighting his way up and out. Romance can’t be
entirely satisfying, you know, when it has ambition for
a rival. You’ve told me something about the thrall of
a book in yourself—how engrossing it is.”</p>

<p>“That all goes out of me when I’m with him,” Pidge
said suddenly. “I never thought of it before, but all
that old agony to produce another book that I used to
feel is gone. I seem to let him carry all that.”</p>

<p>“That helps for the present, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it isn’t all sordid—don’t think I mean that,
Miss Claes. Sometimes when he’s satisfied with his
story, so that he can forget it, we have such good times.
He’s such a playboy, such a playmate. Some old terrible
longing comes over me when we are close like that,
just to be like one of the Mediterranean women, who
know nothing but to replenish the earth. But it doesn’t
do to dwell on that,” Pidge finished with an impressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
quietness of tone. “One thing I learned rather well,
before it was too late.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Pidge?”</p>

<p>“That this isn’t the time or place for us to bring a
little baby into the world.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVI<br />

<small>THE HANGING SOCK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NAGAR was changed. On the day that Richard
Cobden reached Ahmedabad, he encountered
one of the surprises of his life. It was
like meeting a man out in the freedom of the world,
whom one had only known before in prison. Two
years in the East had sharpened Dicky’s eyes to note
something in Nagar’s face that he had been unable to
detect before. Dicky called it cleanliness and calm, but
this brought up the old difficulty which he never missed
in his work of writing—that at best, words only suggest,
only intimate.</p>

<p>In America Nagar had looked dark; here he looked
fair. There he had moved in and out as one of the
colored men; here he was one of the elect. There he
had lived in the midst of silences and mysterious inhibitions,
diminished by the garments of Western civilization;
here he was white-robed in the sunlight, like
young Gautama in his father’s garden. Of course,
Dicky knew that the change was more substantial than
that of garb or place. He could only repeat that Nagar
seemed free in his own mind.</p>

<p>In the first few moments at the station in Ahmedabad,
Dicky had himself felt unwashed and unwholesome,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
as no man ever made him feel before. His hand
went up to his chin. Yes, he had shaved that morning,
but realizing it did not help much. It wasn’t the grime
of travel that hurt him, but the smear of his recent mental
and emotional overturning, the ugliness of all those
days in the red room at Bombay, and the sense of failure
and loss he lived with constantly since the coming
of the letter from Pidge.</p>

<p>“... And the Little Man is actually here in Ahmedabad,
and not a myth?” Dicky had asked, as they drew
out of the crowd at the station.</p>

<p>“Not only that, but you are to go to the <i>Ashrama</i>
now, if you will. He is eager to have you come.”</p>

<p>“His house first?” Dicky asked.</p>

<p>“It is also the house in which I live,” said Nagar.</p>

<p>“You mean you wish to put me up in your quarters?”</p>

<p>“If you would not mind our great simplicity.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I should like that,” said Dicky, “but I
think it would be better for me to follow the usual
course of a foreigner and find hotel quarters.”</p>

<p>The <i>Entresden</i> was not crowded and Dicky obtained
comfortable quarters in a northeast room where the
upholstering was covered in clean tan linen, and the
<i>punkahs</i> showed signs of life immediately upon their
entrance. Nagar prepared to leave as soon as Dicky
sat down in the air crossing between two shaded windows.</p>

<p>“I will come for you this afternoon if you wish to
go to the <i>Ashrama</i> to-day,” he said. “It is some distance
from the center of the city.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“Sit down, Nagar; don’t hurry off.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would prefer to rest until after
<i>tiffin</i>.”</p>

<p>“Stay and we’ll have it here. You’ll pour the tea
like the old days in Miss Claes’ room.”</p>

<p>Nagar’s face was in the shadows, but there was a
soft shining as of polished silver in or around his eyes.
At times, shutting his eyes as Nagar spoke, Dicky could
almost believe he was back in the basement at Harrow
Street. The way Nagar said to him, “my friend,” was
almost Miss Claes herself. That was the poignant part
of finding the Oriental again; that he brought back
Harrow Street—even moments under the white light.
The day would have been joyous but for the aching
emptiness of heart. Dicky asked tirelessly about
Gandhi, especially since it gave him such a chance to
study the new Nagar.</p>

<p>“Mahatma-ji has burned away all waste,” Nagar
said at length. “He has narrowed himself down, body
and mind, to an almost perfect obedience—self-control.
He measures action to all his words. The best he
knows, step by step, he performs.”</p>

<p>“Where did you hear of him first?”</p>

<p>“Here in India—of his work in South Africa. I
went there to know him better—followed the gleam, as
you might say. I stayed four years. It was he who
encouraged me to go to America to study more of the
spirit of the West.”</p>

<p>“What’s Gandhi’s message to these people?”</p>

<p>“He believes that politics cannot be successfully divorced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
from religion,” Nagar said. “His message always
is toward the spiritualizing of India’s political life
and her institutions. The spiritual predominance of
India, which he idealizes as being the real destiny of
India, can only be effected by her rebecoming herself,
by the return of the Motherland into herself, by her
ceasing to imitate all the ways of western civilization.”</p>

<p>“But if she returns into herself, making her own
goods, cutting herself off from all institutions of the
present government—England will be done for here.”</p>

<p>Nagar bowed without the trace of a smile.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that every turn of a spinning-wheel in
India takes part of a turn from a power loom in Manchester,”
Dicky added.</p>

<p>Nagar further acquiesced.</p>

<p>“And that isn’t politics?... I think I’ll go in
for religion, myself.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It is very good to have you here,” Nagar said
later. “Mahatma-ji will also be glad. He has asked
much about you and believes that you may be a means
of making many in America understand. It is a saying
with us here that ‘to understand is to love.’”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t come here with any set idea, you
know.”</p>

<p>“The work you will do for us in America will be the
better for that. The more reason and rationale you
bring——”</p>

<p>“Evidently it’s easy for one to go off his head where
Gandhi is,” Dicky said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“His effect on some is subtle and strong.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep a stiff bridle arm. Say, Nagar, have you
stopped to think how I happen to be here to-day?”</p>

<p>“Tell me, please.”</p>

<p>“One hanging sock.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“One hanging sock. It was that which made me go
out into the reception room in the first place, that day
you brought the story to <i>The Public Square</i>. I heard
the office boy say to J. H., ‘He keeps pulling up his
sock.’ I went out to see. So that’s what made me go
to Harrow Street, and meet Miss Claes and the rest
and go to Africa, and come here. I believe that’s what
started the World War.”</p>

<p>Nagar laughed. “I always had such trouble in the
early days with American clothing. I would get one
part working and another would give way——”</p>

<p>“But, Nagar, what made it so imperative for you to
have the two hundred that day?”</p>

<p>“A ship was leaving within twenty-four hours for
the Mediterranean to connect with South African
ports. Mahatma-ji was greatly in need of funds to
carry on his work.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were ill—possibly starving.”</p>

<p>“I was ill from strain—self-consciousness. It was
one of the hardest things I ever had to do—to stand up
against America in the office of <i>The Public Square</i>.”</p>

<p>“You certainly put it over. But what made you so
silent in New York? It’s an actual shock to find you
chatty and human, like this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Certain of us in India are trained differently from
American ways. You perhaps have read that in the
Pythagorean schools, a period of silence was enjoined
among the young men. It was so in my training. We
seek to silence all opinions, all half-truths, all thinking,
in fact, in order to <i>Know</i>. We postulate, of course, a
center of Spontaneous Knowledge, or Genius, above
the mind. To learn obedience to this, one takes a vow
of silence——”</p>

<p>“Ah, I remember! Pidge—Miss Musser—I mean
Mrs. Melton, told me something of the kind!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVII<br />

<small>THE MAHATMA AND THE MIRACLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">COBDEN heard the voice before he saw the
man. Standing in a darkened hall of the
bungalow, spoken of as the <i>Ashrama</i>, the
voice of one speaking English in easy cultured tones
reached his ears. When the door opened, he saw several
native young men sitting upon the floor and a
wasted Hindu figure in the center—a little man in a
thin turban more like a skullcap; a homespun loincloth,
his bare feet beneath him upon a mat of coarse cloth, a
rough pillow at his back. The young men about him
had risen, but the central figure merely lifted and extended
the hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cobden from America,” Gandhi said. “Nagarjuna
has made us eager to welcome you.”</p>

<p>Even Nagar withdrew, but one of the boys returned
bringing a chair.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, I’ll try sitting on the floor, too,”
Dicky told the latter. “I’d feel perched with Mr.
Gandhi sitting below.”</p>

<p>The Mahatma smiled. “I quite appreciate,” he said.
“I hope you will find in India the same kindness that
you gave Nagarjuna in New York.”</p>

<p>Dicky had expected power; he found composure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
His idea of power was perhaps in part a hang-over
from a boyish ideal of a certain American financial
executive. Nothing of that in this room; rather he was
conscious of Gandhi’s frailness and smallness. This
presence called forth impulses to be tender, to lower
one’s voice, to hurry to bring anything wanted. He
was shocked a little at the twisted, battered look of the
features. The lips looked pulpy in parts and did not
rest together evenly. The smile was curiously slow—tentative,
like one in whom understanding dawns. Back
of the iron-rimmed spectacles and tired eyes, so inured
to pain, was the essence of fearlessness. This was the
first commanding characteristic to the American.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“... Fear,” Gandhi was saying, “fear of death
makes us devoid both of valor and religion. There is
no place for fear in the <i>Satyagrahi’s</i> heart.”</p>

<p>“What is a <i>Satyagrahi</i>?” Cobden asked.</p>

<p>“One who is devoted and pledged to truth, to <i>Satyagraha</i>.
I coined the word, to express our purpose in
South Africa. <i>Satyagraha</i> is the use of Love-force or
Soul-force.”</p>

<p>Curiously, Dicky felt the cleanness of the house, the
peace of it, the humming of a <i>charka</i> in the next room,
a symbol of that peace. He felt Gandhi’s face growing
upon him out of the shadow, a face that had been dried
cleanly by many suns, the features fashioned by a life
of direct, unpredatory thinking—the face of a man incapable,
even in thought, of hitting below the belt. And
now, there was to go with the hum of the <i>charka</i>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
faint fragrance of dried fruit in the air, or that sweetness
one breathes in the altitudes where the sun is shining
upon the great conifers.</p>

<p>“The world has talked much of the omnipotence of
God,” Mahatma-ji went on. “India, at last, is preparing
to put her faith to test. Passive resistance has been
called the weapon of the weak; if this is so, the Soul is
weaker than the flesh. Passive resistance calls upon its
devotees to endure great suffering, even martyrdom and
death. Those who believe it is too difficult to carry out
do not trust the Soul. They are not moved by true
courage.”</p>

<p>There was no pose nor show, no straining for force,
rarely an adjective or simile, no shadings of sense—a
direct approach, inevitably direct. Dicky felt suddenly
hopeless of ever understanding such directness. For
the first time in his life, he realized that all his training
to live and to write was less than straight. He had
been taught half-tones, shadows to accentuate lights.
Here was directness.</p>

<p>Gandhi resumed: “It is the sacred principle of love
which moves mountains. To us is the responsibility of
living out this sacred law; we are not concerned with
results.”</p>

<p>“No such thing then as righteous anger?” Dicky
asked.</p>

<p>“There is not for us. Anger is the misuse of force.
Anger in thought is an enemy to clear thinking, to
understanding. To understand is to love. Anger in
action tends to become violence, and violence is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
negation of spiritual force. In fact, only those who
eschew violence can avail themselves of their real powers.
Only those who realize that there is something in
man which is superior to the brute nature in him, and
that the latter always yields to it, can effectively apply
this force, which is to violence, and therefore to all
tyranny, all injustice, what light is to darkness. For
the exercise of the purest Soul-force, prolonged training
of the individual Soul is an absolute necessity.”</p>

<p>Just now Dicky was contending with the feeling that
he was in the presence of an evangelist or healer. He
had difficulty for the moment in recalling that Gandhi
was world-trained; a lawyer of London’s careful making;
an opponent of governments in South Africa; a
man found powerful enough in his own person to be
reckoned with by the established laws of men of high
place.</p>

<p>“We have many things to ask of England,” Gandhi
said, “and she has promised us her attention, as soon as
her present difficulties give her freedom of heart and
hand to attend our wants here. To press our wants
now, or to force our desires upon England in her crisis
in Europe, would be taking an unfair advantage. So
this is a time for us in India to cleanse and prepare
ourselves for future action, sacrifice if necessary——”</p>

<p>At one moment Gandhi’s face was dull and unattractive
as a camel driver’s; again it shone with a high
clear calm, like the ideal most of us have of a saint or
a priest. Now the instant came, as the words stopped,
that Dicky seemed to be looking into the Indian face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
actually for the first time, and Gandhi was looking <i>into</i>
him. The American was uncentered for a second or
two, as he had once felt in the quick sag of an airplane
in a bit of rough going.</p>

<p>It began to become clear to the caller that there were
only a few constantly vibrating themes in this man’s
talk: the necessity for nonviolence; the control of self,
essential before the control of others can be contemplated;
the establishment of altruism as a basis for all
political activity; the return of India into her own destiny
of a handicraft civilization, which involved the
making and using of her own goods and the turning of
her back upon the “monster of a mechanical civilization”;
freedom of speech, devotion to truth, fearlessness,
always that.</p>

<p>Dicky now actually contemplated the look of unearthly
calm in the eyes of the man before him. Was
it fanaticism—this fearlessness which Gandhi put into
practice? Was there a soul-calm back of the human
nervous system, a central calm that a man could reach
and abide in, that made anything negligible that men
might do to the body? Was there something really
that Miss Claes and Nagar and this man talked about—something
that went on and on, that loved one’s
enemies, that loved one’s love, no matter what this life
effected to keep them apart? Was it worth going after,
since every ordinary viewpoint seemed changed in those
who had touched it?... Surely India was getting
him going—he, Dicky Cobden, of the family of trowel
makers! In amazement, he realized that he was responding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
to some stimulus like the finest wine—that if
he didn’t get out of here soon, he would fall to telling
his troubles like a man who has had too many drinks.</p>

<p>Gandhi was speaking of his workers and devotees
here in Ahmedabad; the manner of their life together:</p>

<p>“So in our <i>Ashrama</i>,” he explained, “every child is
taught to understand political institutions and to know
how his country is vibrating with new emotions, with
new aspirations, with new life.... As for men and
women living and working together in the <i>Ashrama</i>,
they must live the celibate life whether married or unmarried.
Marriage brings a woman close together with
a man, and they become friends in a special sense, never
to be parted in this life or in the lives to come; but I
do not think that into that place of life, our lusts should
necessarily enter.”</p>

<p>Dicky had scrambled to his feet from the floor.</p>

<p>“I won’t take your time any more just now,” he
mumbled haltingly.</p>

<p>Mahatma-ji watched him with a look of gentlest
understanding.</p>

<p>Dicky backed out. He was in the street alone....
The young men had not restrained him in the slightest.
They had seemed to understand that he must be alone.
Even Nagar had only walked at his side a moment in
the hall, to say that he would come to the <i>Entresden</i>
after dinner.... He was alone in the outskirts of the
city with the miracle. Somewhere among Gandhi’s
sentences about men and women, it had happened—somewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
in there, when he had spoken about—yes,
that was it, “about friends in a special sense!...”</p>

<p>A pariah dog yelped, running out of a doorway, almost
banging into his knees. He was in a narrow
street, and had to step upon a doorsill, while two men
passed dragging at a cart. He saw their bare ribs and
salt-whitened loin cloths. The sun was still high; the
stillness and heat almost fetid in the byways. He
passed a native market place by the river, and out of all
the moving multicolored crowd, he remembered only
one parasol of jade green, though he did not see the
face beneath.</p>

<p>His American-trained mind scoffed against the thing
that had happened, but his heart held on serenely....
What did this little world-warrior with the battered
mouth know about love and living with a woman?
What did he know about lusts that he spoke so freely
of? Did he ever give three years of his life to the one
battle—not to hate the woman he loved most under
heaven? Or was that particular battle so far back in
his experience that he merely spoke of it as one skirmish
in the great campaign of fifty years, called Life?</p>

<p>Alone at dinner at the <i>Entresden</i>, Dicky conned every
word the Little Man had spoken about the young married
people who worked together in the <i>Ashrama</i>, of
the celibacy they vowed themselves to, of their becoming
through marriage “friends in a special sense—for
this and all lives.” Yes, Gandhi talked as if it were a
foregone conclusion that there were other lives....</p>

<p>He wasn’t tasting his dinner.... He came up from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
the deeps of reflection to realize a waiter was coming
toward him, as if in answer to a signal. He also discovered
that he had been sitting over his filled plate with
one hand lifted—the thumb and fingers brushing together,
as if he were close to <i>her</i>, and it was a bit of
her dress or a wisp of her hair between his fingers.
His mind could scoff all it pleased, for his heart held
serenely to the miracle, and this was the miracle: that
Pidge Musser, married or not married, was back alive
in his heart; and such a melting pity for her plight had
come to him as he sat before the Little Man, that he,
the hardheaded, had to rise abruptly from the interview
and rush away, lest he fall to weeping and explaining
all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXVIII<br />

<small>THE RACK OF SEX</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DICKY and Nagar sat under the <i>punkahs</i> in the
room at the <i>Entresden</i>—that stillest, hottest
night. A fierce stimulus was driving the
American. Moment by moment he realized it more
clearly—that his love had come back to him, or some
strange new fire from it, as he had talked with Mahatma-ji.
It compelled him, mind and emotion now, and
his questions were insatiable, but he was slow and
roundabout in getting to the core of matters that fascinated.</p>

<p>“For instance, what makes him starve himself?”
Dicky asked.</p>

<p>“He has no illusions about fasting,” Nagar answered.
“Mahatma-ji objects to the distractions of
the body. He keeps down this drum of the senses by
severity of handling, an old well-tried way of the East.
Ask an expert horseman what to do with a spirited
saddle horse that has a tendency now and then to take
the bit and run away. ‘Cut down his grain, and he will
be easier to handle,’ you will be told.”</p>

<p>Dicky was groping feverishly within himself as the
other talked. “But what has celibacy to do——” he
halted and finished, “with politics and all that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Mahatma-ji has made himself free from the rack
of sex and the drum of the senses—enough to realize
his great work for others, for India. We who follow
him wish to do the same. We understand that we have
not the great gift for India, until we are free; that is,
only a man who has freed himself from his own desires
can help greatly to free others, or his country. We are
not free agents so long as we are on the rack of sex.
We cannot hate ourselves off that rack; in fact, we
must learn to love more, not less, to escape.”</p>

<p>“Tunnel,” Dicky said. “No man educated on the
Hudson can get that sort of thing. Have a heart,
Nagar.”</p>

<p>“It is my poor telling——”</p>

<p>Dicky smiled and smoked: “I can’t see how he’d have
anything left to give the world,” he added—“a man
who got on top of himself that way.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The thing that Dicky had found in the same room
with the Little Man wasn’t happiness, but it was better
than the deadness he had known; good to feel the tissues
of his heart alive again, not a leaden lump.</p>

<p>Again the next day, he went to sit with Mahatma-ji,
but nothing happened, though he remained two hours.
On one side he had come to doubt the whole business;
on the other he had been naïve enough half to believe
that all he had to do was to enter the presence of the
Indian leader to get this living thing back in his heart,
this pain that had the breath of life in it. Two days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
afterward, however, while he was deeply involved with
Gandhi’s explanation of <i>Satyagraha</i>, taking notes so
that he could put down the other’s words almost exactly,
the sense of Pidge Musser’s presence and plight was
suddenly with him again, renewed within him, the pity
of it almost more than he could endure.</p>

<p>There were hours also when Dicky could believe
almost anything at the <i>Ashrama</i>, where he was permitted
to sit with the native students (Gandhi often
halting his speech in Hindi or Guzerati, to talk English
for the American’s benefit). And occasionally during
long evening talks with Nagar, on the banks of the
Sabarmati or under the muffle-winged <i>punkahs</i> in the
<i>Entresden</i> room, Dicky’s mind had sudden extensions
of range. Still he had a vague foreboding that he
would not be able to hold all this hopeful stuff when he
was away from India, for slowly and surely he was
being pressed to depart.</p>

<p>“America needs your loyalty now,” Nagar said.
“We will send for you to come when the curtain rises
here. The drama of India is not being played now, but
the Play is written. This that you have heard, so far,
is only a rehearsal of minor parts.”</p>

<p>In June, a letter came from <i>The Public Square</i>, pressing
its correspondent to return to France, or at least to
some of the points where the American troops were
gathering.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... As for magazine conditions, Dicky [John
Higgins wrote], they couldn’t be worse. Our little old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
<i>Public Square</i> has fallen into sorry ways.... If
you’ve had a German neighbor for thirty years and
learned cautiously to respect the beast, you’re supposed
now to know him no more, in trade or whist or home
or club, nor his woman nor children. Old England’s
bloomed out more seductive than ever, and this country’s
infatuated. You couldn’t believe it. We’re more
English than Canada right now. She’s borrowed everything
in sight and is so tickled over herself that she’s
beginning to laugh at us already. It’s a fact, her big
business men can’t keep the joke any longer.... But
I only meant to tell you that <i>The Public Square</i> has
nothing to say, nothing to do. We tried a critical study
of the architecture of a federal building in Des Moines,
and we’re being looked into for unpatriotic motives.
A lot of American business men, who once gloried in
their breadth and toleration, have taken positions in
what they call the Department of Justice, and their
business is to probe into speeches and writings like ours.
They are looking for heresies of citizenship. If we’re
not suspended for making a croak, we’ll likely be forced
to suspend for not having the breath. Otherwise, we’re
quite well, and the trade world—you ought to be able
to hear American business boom, even in India—if
you’re not too far inland.</p>
</div>

<p>For the first time John Higgins’ views looked diminished
to Dicky Cobden’s eyes. This personal treason
he laid to India. He made an arrangement, however,
to help <i>The Public Square</i> to keep alive.... Gandhi
was called to Lucknow, and Dicky saw him into his
third-class coach, with a catch in his throat and a sadness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
of heart. A day or two later he left Nagar at the
station where he found him—and the day looked dull
and gloomy from the windows of the Bombay <i>Inter
Provincial</i>, as the American started south alone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXIX<br />

<small>RUFUS’ PLAY DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">RUFUS MELTON was having his coffee at
Miss Claes’ table. It was noon and July,
1917. The package of mail left at 54 Harrow
Street had not forgotten Rufus this morning.
Another story had gone through, and he felt that the
day was all right. It looked to him like a very good
day to play and to shop. Miss Claes came in from the
kitchen in a fresh white dress and canvas shoes, nor did
she come empty handed. A crystal and silver marmalade
jar was in one hand, and a plate of cold ham in the
other. These she placed on the cloth before him; and
noting that the loaf of rye bread lay uncut upon the
board, she went to a drawer for the knife.</p>

<p>Rufus dropped a cube of sugar into his coffee cup
and contemplated Miss Claes’ ankle. His mind became
industrious. He was thinking how he would describe
the ankle if he were using it in a story. He thought of
several narrow white things. There was a white greyhound,
but you couldn’t say a woman’s ankle was like
that. There was a white pleasure yacht on the river,
with narrow lines and clipper bow that bore a psychological
likeness, but it would take a paragraph to put
that over. The boneheads would think of boiler plate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Then there was a birch tree and a polar bear and a
snowy church spire ... anyway the ankle was fetching.</p>

<p>“You look great this morning, Miss Claes, and see
here——”</p>

<p>He spread out his letter from a most rich and inaccessible
editorial room.</p>

<p>“How interesting, Rufus. You are doing so well
with your stories.”</p>

<p>“Pidge thinks they’re rotten,” he chuckled.</p>

<p>No comment from Miss Claes.</p>

<p>“She’d have me sit in a cave and growl over a story—bringing
one out every three months for editors to
muss their hair over and finally turn down. That’s the
life——”</p>

<p>Miss Claes had turned to the cabinet of dishes, the
double doors of which were open. One might have
thought that Rufus was now entirely involved in the
subject of Pidge’s idea of stories, but in reality he was
studying Miss Claes’ waist and throat and profile. Her
particular freshness from boots up this morning fascinated
his eye. She took his coffee cup to the kitchen
to be refilled, and when she came back close to his chair,
Rufus’ arm moved engagingly around her hips, his face
turning up with a questioning boyish smile.</p>

<p>“What is it, Rufus?” she asked, making no movement
to be free from his arm.</p>

<p>“You’re mighty charming this morning——”</p>

<p>“It’s a charming morning.”</p>

<p>His arm tightened a little, yet she stood perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
still. Rufus was now in a quandary. This sitting posture
had its diminishing aspect: yet to arise and disentangle
his feet from under the table, he must loosen his
arm or show an uncouth line to the camera, so to speak.
Rufus rarely broke his rhythms in these little performances;
certainly not when the going was as delicate as
this. Miss Claes had become especially desirable, because
of an exciting uncertainty about her, and an affectation,
at least, of allegiance to Pidge. If he had
only had sense enough to turn his chair around, before
taking her in. Presently Rufus reached the conclusion
that it was better to draw her down to him, than take
a chance of getting his arm around her again.</p>

<p>She came—no resistance, no rigidity. His lips found
her shadowy cheek, and an indescribable and most disturbing
fragrance from her neck and hair. Or was it
the extraordinary coolness of everything that disturbed,
or the words gently whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>“You’re such a lonely boy. You don’t understand at
all what you are really dying for.”</p>

<p>Rufe was disappointed. So hers was the mothering
game. Besides his position was uncomfortable, knees
under the table, and his coffee was getting cold. So he
let her go after all, in order to reach a standing posture,
but by the time he was free of the chair and the table,
Miss Claes had vanished without haste into the kitchen.
Rufus now stood dangling inconveniently between his
breakfast and her return.</p>

<p>She came; he went to her. Her dark eyes were utterly
calm, no traceable deepening of the color in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
face. She halted, but lightly held in the two hands before
her was a gold-edged dish, with a little golden
globe of butter in the center.</p>

<p>Rufus dropped back in his chair and lifted his coffee
cup. What on earth could a man do with a woman
holding a butter dish? “It’s hell to be fastidious,” he
thought, in regard to his own inhibitions.</p>

<p>Something delectable had gone out of the July day.
Miss Claes was no nearer his understanding than before.
Pidge would have the laugh on him, because
these women could never keep anything to themselves.
He didn’t mind anything about Pidge so much as her
laugh. Altogether, this little brush at breakfast left
him unsatisfied—and this was a play day.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he said at the door.</p>

<p>She gave him a pink, an old-fashioned white one.
“The butter-and-egg-man brought in some from his
dooryard garden in Yonkers,” she said.</p>

<p>Rufe started upstairs.</p>

<p>There were voices from one of the rooms on the
main floor, but the second was entirely empty and silent
until a rear door opened and Fanny Gallup looked out.</p>

<p>“Hello,” she said in a far-reaching whisper.</p>

<p>Fanny’s “hello” was one of the best of her little
ways. She said it, as one would cast a silken noose.</p>

<p>Rufe looked back and down. On certain mornings
he would have growled an answer and tramped on, but
there was something white and calling about the face
in the dim shadows this morning, and for a wonder the
kids weren’t squalling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“Oh, come in. Come on in!” was in his ears. Her
bare arm was raised and he saw the little muffler of
dark in the pit of it. The lacing was gone from the
smock, moreover, and there was a pull for the moment
to Fanny’s sad little breast. The fact that the smock
had once been Pidge’s, Rufe thrust back into his mind
for future reference. He halted, looking around and
listening again. Then he tiptoed in and the door was
shut. Not a great while afterward the door was opened,
the crying of children was heard. Fanny was moaning,
“Don’t go ’way—oh, don’t go ’way!”</p>

<p>But Rufus breasted past her muttering within himself,
“Never again!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>... Pidge and Rufe Melton went over to Bank
Street for supper that evening. Rufus wasn’t hungry.
He had bought a golf suit that looked very well
on him, he said, but evidently now he was troubled how
to use it. He hadn’t done any work so far to-day and
felt less like it than ever. Pidge thoughtlessly mentioned
that an Indian letter had come in to the office
from Richard Cobden that day.</p>

<p>“You folks are dippy about this Cobden,” Rufe said.
“Every time an article of his comes out in the <i>Passé
Square</i>, you gather together to read it as if it had come
from the Messiah. What’s he to you, Pan—a little bit
tender on your Dicky?”</p>

<p>“A little bit tender,” she said.</p>

<p>Rufus felt abused. He glared at her. This sort of
thing had happened before. Rufe had come to look at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
Pidge as his picket pin. He had a long rope and everything
was all right, so long as the pin held. But her
manner now would uncenter any man.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get out of Harrow Street,” he growled.
“Every time I put my address on the top of a manuscript,
I feel it’s a knock rather than a boost. I’ve been
tempted to get an agent, for no other reason than to
have his address for the magazines to work through.
I was talking with Redge Walters who bought this
story to-day, and he said, ‘Rufe, you sure fall for the
little bobbed heads down in the Village, don’t you?
Why don’t you come uptown and live in New York?’”</p>

<p>“I like Harrow Street,” said Pidge.</p>

<p>“You don’t make a secret of it, either,” he went on.
“Of course, Miss Claes is kind and all that, but we pay
for what we get, and there’s no question in my mind
about the pictures in her gallery being hung crooked.”</p>

<p>“If you’ve finished your supper, let’s go,” said Pidge.</p>

<p>“She breathes! The Arctic princess!” Rufe shivered.</p>

<p>Pidge didn’t answer.</p>

<p>“And that second floor needs policing up,” Rufe resumed.
“I haven’t taken it to heart so much about
living in the Village, but that second floor’s a tenement
patch. Every time I go up and down——”</p>

<p>“Fanny’s my fault and Miss Claes accepts it with
never a murmur,” Pidge said, wide-eyed. “I’d look
well running off uptown and leaving Fanny there. Oh,
Rufe, don’t you ever see any fault except on the outside?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>Right then Rufe said something.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of me looking after my own faults
when you’ve got them all in hand like Shetland ponies?”</p>

<p>Pidge arose. Black waters were welling up in her
breast. It was so true. His faults were with her day
and night, and the greatest of them was his entire
irresponsibility. Also it touched her in the sorest quick
to have him point out that Fanny lowered the values,
not only of the second floor, but of the whole Harrow
Street house.</p>

<p>Pidge never passed Fanny’s door but she was pressed
by something within to enter; yet her whole personal
nature rebelled. Often for hours at her work, there
was a gloomy semiconscious activity within her that
kept urging its notice up to her mind. When she
stopped to think, she would realize that she hadn’t gone
into Fanny’s room that day, or that she must drop in
to-night. It was so now, only more than ever, because
Rufe had located her private horror and brought it to
speech. On the second floor, returning from supper,
she told Rufe to go on up, that she meant to see Fanny
for a few minutes.</p>

<p>“What to—come on, Pan, let’s go to a show somewhere!”
he said suddenly.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“There isn’t a clot of work stirring in my brain pan,”
he went on.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go out. I’ve got to see Fanny——”</p>

<p>He caught her sleeve. “It’s too hot to go up. Let’s
go somewhere. Let’s get on a bus and go uptown——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>She was too occupied in the thing she hated to do,
to notice his concern. He spoke again:</p>

<p>“I’m not going up there alone. You’re colder than
a frog to live with anyway——”</p>

<p>“Go out somewhere, Rufe, if you want to. Don’t
mind me.”</p>

<p>She didn’t hear his words, but she heard the crying
of Fanny’s children. The door opened. Fanny stood
there, but looked past her, over Pidge’s shoulder, and
queerly enough Pidge thought of the words, “And Jove
nods to Jove.” The hall door was then shut.</p>

<p>“Wot you coming in here for—to scold me some
more, Redhead?”</p>

<p>“No, Fanny, to see you and the——”</p>

<p>“I know why you come, all right. To find fault—that’s
why, and you needn’t kill yourself, because I’m
gettin’ along, so-so. Little old Fanny’s holdin’ her own—and
that’s more’n you’re doin’.”</p>

<p>Pidge looked into the crib. A core of fetid vapor
hung above it, and Fanny’s words seemed to blend
with it.</p>

<p>“Think you can hold your job and hold a man, too,
don’t you? Oh, yes, Redhead knows how. Redhead’s
got it all worked out. Redhead can tell us all how to
do it, oh, yes——”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Fanny? Are you scolding, so
I won’t start? I didn’t come to start something. Just
came to see you. Wouldn’t you like to go out for an
hour and have me stay with the—with the——”</p>

<p>Pidge always halted this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“Worried—eh? Worried about somethin’?” Fanny
piped up. “Well, I’m not tellin’ anything—except
you ain’t got your little mastiff tied to no corset
string——”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about, Fanny?”</p>

<p>“Like to know. Wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>Pidge felt cold. She cared to know what the other
meant. She didn’t say so, however. She knew a better
way—an effective way that seemed to come out of
depths within her that knew vast pasts and many lands,
all strategies of men and maids, all secrets of tent and
purdah, lattice and veil.</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble, Fanny. I just came in to see how
you were getting on. I’m so sorry, you know——”</p>

<p>“Sorry——” Fanny laughed.</p>

<p>“So sorry, dear—that you’re penned in this way—and
Albert missing!”</p>

<p>“Sorry!” Fanny screamed her mirth.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want me to be sorry for you, dear?”
Pidge trailed. “Why, I haven’t been nearly so good as
I meant to be——”</p>

<p>“Well, you dam’ little itch-face—talking to me about
being sorry. Who’n heller-you to tell me about being
sorry? Who’n heller-you to talk to me about me gettin’
penned in an’ Albert missin’, when you can’t keep
your own man—when you don’t carry your own babies?
Who’n heller-you anyway?”</p>

<p>Then Fanny got down to business and spoke of
life in the here and now.</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear,” said Pidge. “We can’t attend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
to everything. I’m going out to get you some ice cream.
I’ll be back in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>She was in the street. She brought back a paper pail
without haste. Fanny had begun to cry.</p>

<p>“Don’t feel badly,” Pidge said, washing a saucer and
spoon.</p>

<p>Fanny cried on. Pidge served her a large dish, and
a smaller one for the older child. Then from the paper,
she spooned tiny mouthfuls into the face in the crib—spooned
until there was sleep from the novel coolness
of the sweet. Then Pidge patted Fanny’s shoulder, as
she passed out, promising to come back some time to-morrow.</p>

<p>Upstairs she found Rufe, shirt open at the throat,
standing by the back window. The light in the room
was heavily shaded. He looked to her covertly, half
expectantly.</p>

<p>“Want to read something?” he said in a pleasant
tone.</p>

<p>“No. I’m going to bed,” said Pidge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXX<br />

<small>THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EARLY the next morning in the shadowy back
room, Pidge moved softly about as she dressed.
She saw the new golf suit, and her lips twisted
into a smile. Another toy; another bit of acting. That
was all of the game he cared for—the clothes that went
with it. She thought of the night on the corner when
the newsboy had pointed out Rufe as a movie actor.
She saw his desk by the window. It looked like a
troubled face. Here she was, as usual, furiously busy
with his faults—so occupied that he didn’t have to
bother at all, sleeping serenely on. But he didn’t understand,
never could understand, that her agony was because
she saw them as part of herself; that in her own
heart she couldn’t free herself from responsibility;
knowing deeply the <i>dis</i>-ease that comes from that soul-deep
question, “Am I my brother’s keeper?”</p>

<p>And there he was lying on his back, innocent as a
child. The pain darted into her heart ... the baby
carriage at Santa Monica. His complexion was almost
as fresh, his black hair brushed back. It was as if he
had fallen asleep with a tear in his eyes, for a little
penciling of salt was on the thin blue-veined skin under
the eyelid. His breast was uncovered and that spoiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
the picture, spoiled the pathos; for Rufe, though the
least athletic of men, was hairy and glad of it.</p>

<p>She hadn’t slept. This, since coming home last night,
was a show-down time, as she expressed it. She had
met the same several times with her father, when the
days became so black and evil that something had to
happen. Deep, under words and surface thoughts, lay
the affair of Fanny’s room. The dreary consciousness
of that never left her, but actual thinking of details was
another affair. She couldn’t give way to them, and
keep the outer quiet she had determined upon. She had
been too honest to hide from herself, even in the beginning,
that Rufe habitually took life as it came. She
never could forget his first appraisal of herself in the
reception room of <i>The Public Square</i>.</p>

<p>So this hadn’t come in the nature of shock; rather it
was a pitiless uncovering of ugliness that had been
vaguely subconscious before. What hurt her most
keenly, so that she was close to crying out, as she lay
beside him in the night, was the inevitable tramp of
Fate, audible through it all—their meeting in Dicky’s
room; Dicky’s opening of <i>The Public Square</i> to him in
the first place; her own bringing of Fanny Gallup to
this house; the weaving back and forth into one, of the
different lives—even her father’s.</p>

<p>Rufe wasn’t at home when she returned that night.
He hadn’t rung her at the office, but she found word
with Miss Claes that he had gone down to Washington.
She felt something was going to happen, but through
the day she had gathered her strength together to decide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
that she wouldn’t be the one to bring it about.
Underneath all was the old sense of her responsibility.</p>

<p>Pidge was half tempted to seek Miss Claes this night.
She even went so far as to learn that her friend was at
home. It always happened so, when she needed help:
Miss Claes might be out any or at all other times. A
light was in the basement room, and no voices, but
Pidge crept back upstairs without speaking.... She
had failed. She had run away from her father, failing
there; failing here. She must see this through alone a
little longer.... The next afternoon Rufe called for
her at <i>The Public Square</i>. His eyes held a glint of
triumph.</p>

<p>“I’m going to France,” he said, when they were in
the street. “I’ve arranged to do a big feature for
Redge Walters and a Sunday newspaper syndicate set.”</p>

<p>“But how about the draft?”</p>

<p>“Went down to Washington to start things going to
fix that. Redge gave me letters. Looks as if there
won’t be much trouble. You see, the Government
needs the writers—public sentiment, you know.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t that Pidge didn’t think of things to say on
this point of making public sentiment, but a great gray
ennui was over her. She had said enough about his
faults.</p>

<p>“You know, I’ve been smothering in Harrow Street—had
to get away,” he added.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, Rufe.” After a time, she said, “I
think it’s a good thing.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to look at it, Pan,” he said in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
relieved voice, and confided: “I need the experience,
too, you know, because I’ve never been to Europe——”</p>

<p>It was out before she thought: “But how did you
get to the Tunisian sands?”</p>

<p>“I mean I’ve never stayed long enough to look
around. Of course, I’ve passed through.”</p>

<p>He grouched for the rest of the evening, but she felt
worse about this than he did. She had thought she was
through nailing him like that. It had done no good,
merely an additional breaking out of her abysmal temper....
On the night before he left, Rufe was at his
best—the playboy she loved so much; and, of course,
she was pressed harder and harder into the realms of
the Arctic Princess, which was by no means her natural
habitat. At last, he had her crying, which was
something, because it hadn’t happened often.</p>

<p>“Going to miss your Rufie,” he whispered, “sorry
he’s going away?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t that!”</p>

<p>“What is it, Pan?” he demanded in the tone of the
head of a household. “Get it off your mind—don’t
keep anything from me.”</p>

<p>That started her to laughing. “It’s noth-nothing,
Rufe. I’m all right now,” she said brokenly. “I’m
only hurt because I haven’t done it better——”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Us.”</p>

<p>“Forget it,” he said. “I never hold a grudge.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXI<br />

<small>TWO LETTERS FROM INDIA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LATER in July, Miss Claes received letters from
Dicky Cobden and Nagar. Each, it appeared,
had been mainly interested in writing about the
other. She read Dicky’s first:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... I think I’ve seen the Man you wrote of, but I’m
more interested in our own Nagar—altogether different
in his native dress. I never knew how civilized clothes
could slow up a man’s looks. If a white man in New
York were as good-looking as Nagar is here, the movie
folk would kidnap him, if necessary, for the screen....
Things look differently over here. Sitting in this
plain house of the one they call Mahatma-ji, I seem to
understand things that would appear absurd in New
York.... Nagar has opened up. He talks freely and
laughs. He is human, and his American years show in
fine light. Try to think how startling all this was to one
coming up from Bombay, expecting the old sphinx of
your basement and halls.... I find myself frequently
at the <i>Ashrama</i>—a houseful of saints—young men
and women devoted to the Mahatma-ji, like Nagar,
and who apparently have taken vows covering self-sacrifices
unlimited. Gandhi is a bit of old brass with
a mustache; terribly battered, only fifty they say, but
he shows the wear of greater years. I seemed to feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
that he had been frozen, that he had been whipped,
that he had been burned. Some of his teeth are gone....
He tells us that you can’t fight back and expect
to get anywhere. He says to answer a hurt with a
hurt is to prepare for hurt again. He says you never
can understand your enemy by hating him. He says
that India can only triumph by returning into herself.
Imagine such unearthly affairs from a barrister educated
in Middle Temple, London! And Nagar appears
to understand all this.... I haven’t the organs to
believe much. My training hasn’t prepared me easily
to accept miracles—more later, when I cool down. But
Nagar is great to me in himself. I think I find him
more interesting, even than Gandhi. Sometimes he
seems to contain Gandhi. But it would smash everything
I have to work with, if I gave either one of them
my entire belief. Yet I dread the thought of going
away....</p>
</div>

<p>The letter from Nagar was then read slowly twice,
and the smile on the face of Miss Claes gradually lost
itself in a blur of white, as if twilight had crept into
the basement room.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... The American whom we know never speaks
directly of the one he loves; it does not seem to occur
to him that we have sympathy that enfolds his secrets.
He asks questions—asks questions. He shakes his
head. His college-trained intellect does not reach up,
does not hold up its cup to receive the synthesis. It
moves wearily from one to another of its separate
analyses, with only rarely a connective flash of intuition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
But his heart keeps burning, yearning all the time, and
as he learns, he acts. So he seems very safe.... I
have wished so often that he were going to you, instead
of to his work in Europe, but that, of course, is selfish.
He has his work there. We must hold him between
us. He knows already that he will not be able to see
and feel in France, as he does here. It is his ordeal.
I have told him many times; every day, in fact, that
what he sees and feels here, he must remember there,
and hold to, until it is made working knowledge within
him.... Our work is merely preparing. The Little
Man, as Richard calls him affectionately from that old
story, realizes that the hour is not yet. We work in
the midst of many shades of darkness and obliquity and
inhibition. We are marking time, marking time....
Our American will return to India in time to see the
Day break. I have promised to keep him informed.
As Paul Richard says, “We must prepare in ourselves
that magnificent day.”</p>
</div>

<p>Miss Claes sat in silence. Then she seemed to become
aware that voices above vaguely distracted. She
went to the door, and listened. Fanny Gallup was
crying, with little care who heard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXII<br />

<small>FRANCE, 1918. THE YANK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DICKY hadn’t had his clothes off for several
days. He was in the “Oregon” Forest with
Colonel Boulding who was no sort of man to
tie to for one who felt that a clean washrag was one of
the necessities of life. Dicky hadn’t cared for strenuous
field work but it had come to him in France; not
the actions of the big fields so much as the extraordinary
little back-line dramas that break the laws of
perspective by rising more clearly, as days drew on.
Four days before, on his way in to Paris, he had met
Boulding, who was taking out several fresh battalions
to relieve a hard-pressed front at St. Aignan.</p>

<p>“I’ve got an extra horse,” said Boulding, “good old
Yorick, steady as a tram-car, and we’ll be back in three
days.”</p>

<p>Dicky stood in the twilight, half rain, half snow—one
of the interminable waits for order, Boulding back
in the ranks somewhere. The firing had died down and
Dicky dropped his bridle rein to bang his arms about
to get some blood stirring in them. One of the problems
of life just now was why wet snow soaked through
leather quicker than straight rain water; another was
why letters from home always dragged around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
wrong fronts before being delivered; another was how
long was IT going to last; another was hot coffee.</p>

<p>His mount had turned gently away in the thickening
dusk, turned on his toe corks through the slush to
follow a wind-blown leaf. Plop—a water-soaked
trench-siding gave way, and Yorick disappeared into
an unused pit. Dicky stared down into the inky dark.
The beast snorted. A flashlamp was procured from one
of Boulding’s lieutenants and Dicky found his way
down into the trench.</p>

<p>It became clear why Yorick couldn’t rise, even if
unhurt. The trench bottom was a six-inch paste of
water and clay. Holding the flashlight in front of
him, Dicky approached the sprawled beast. Yorick
looked like a monster in the process of being born out
of the mud. There was something both humorous
and hopeless about the gaunt lifted head that came up
into the ray. And now Dicky discovered that Yorick’s
left foreleg below the knee veered off suddenly to
the left, at a decided angle from the way it should lie.
Dicky felt alone in a harrowing under world. The leaf
that had caused it all, or possibly one like it, protruded
from the snaffle ring. Yorick had come up to his leaf
all right, and then forgotten what he had gone after.</p>

<p>“Pretty lucky old boy, you are,” Dicky said. “Work
done, war over for you, nice warm ditch to lie up in
at the last, and I’ve got to take all the responsibility.”</p>

<p>He drew the pistol from his belt and placed it on
the little twist of hair halfway between the eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“I ought to take the saddle off first, but I’m not going
to. So long, old kid, and best luck.”</p>

<p>The pistol banged in the dugout like a cannon
cracker under a flower pot, and the voice of an American
sentry above was heard to say:</p>

<p>“Some fool’s blowed his head off, down there. Why
in hell can’t a man be patient!”</p>

<p>Dicky climbed up on the level ground, no sicker
than before, but a trifle more tired.... He was
chafed. Yorick had done some of it in the last four
days, but not all. He was chafed in and out and
over, chafed from his boots and belt and helmet, but
especially from his key ring. This last had ground
into him all day. He took it out now, as he waited
for coffee. Meanwhile he edged as near as possible
(without murdering anybody) to the trench stove
Boulding’s cook had got going.</p>

<p>There was the key to his mother’s house in Fiftieth
Street—a thick brass stubby affair that belonged to
the door of a house where hardware was well understood.
This key couldn’t be thrown away. Though
it was practically unthinkable—a man might some time
get home. It had been done. There was a key to
54 Harrow Street. The woman who ran the place
had told him to keep it with him, because it was a
symbol of something which he had professed at the
time to understand. Then there was a long, old-fashioned
inside door key, black and a little bent—the
meanest of all to dig into a man’s hip—this to the
hall door of certain rooms in the same Harrow Street<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
house. Its duplicate was in the hands of a girl he used
to know. She had said she would look in on the apartment
while he was gone, but she was married now.
No use keeping it any longer.</p>

<p>He took it off the ring, but put it back again.</p>

<p>Certain things were good, but hard to get. Brandy
was good. Coffee was good, especially hot. Saddle-horse
stew was good. Porkpie, pork and beans, pork
sausage and pancakes were reasonable and of good
report, but keys on key rings that gored a man while
he rode or slept, and stretched back into meanings of
the Utterly Absurd that a man couldn’t get straight
in Paris, much less in this slaughterhouse of the Western
Front—keys on key rings were sheer perversities,
especially when a man wasn’t game to toss them into
any one of these open sewers....</p>

<p>They were saying at home that his stuff was blurred
and unconvincing. Even John Higgins had been singularly
silent of late. Chris Heidt, the managing editor
of his newspaper connection, had recently written:
“We miss that fine patriotic ring that we have come
to expect from our correspondent. Your stuff shows
subtleties and innuendoes and the dissatisfaction of the
boys—the little things back of the lines that make for
disorganization, rather than the big doings at the
front.”</p>

<p>It was dawning on Dicky that there were two kinds
of American patriots, soldier and civilian; and that for
keenness and fire-eating zest, the man in the zone of
advance was not to be compared to the paper-fed folk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
at home. In fact, there were only two ways for a
writer to please the firesides of America, as the hot
flames of Hun-hatred and world-correcting benefactions
went up the chimney. One was to stay at home and
write the war as you supposed it to be, and the other
was to remember how you felt, how the war seemed to
you, before you reached France, and write it from that
angle.</p>

<p>Blurred, all right, and chafed. One thing he was
getting to understand a little, and to have an affection
for. That was the American soldier—not officer, so
much, but the ruffian in the ranks, <i>dogus bogus Americanus</i>—the
fellow fused of Irish, Scotch and Jew, of
German, English, Russian and French; something of
each in the solution, something of all. In the first
place, this Yank was the funniest thing ever turned
loose on the planet. His officers were occasionally funny
in a different way.</p>

<p>Dicky vaguely perceived that an abyss was slowly
but surely forming between this Yank and the patriots
at home—an abyss only to be bridged by silence. Quite
as slowly but surely Dicky’s heart opened to this enlisted
man. One has to love something. Once or
twice, things he saw this laughing maniac from America
do made him very much ashamed of his own mental
antics in a certain red room of Bombay.</p>

<small>PARIS, 1918—HADDON AND AMES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SO far as Dicky was concerned, the things of great
moment in his experience in France all happened
in the fall of 1918. He was in Paris at the end of
that shocking summer, and found a letter from Nagar
which reiterated that the curtain could not rise on the
Drama of India until Great Britain was through fighting
in France and the land of the Euphrates.... He
was stopping at the <i>Garonne</i>. There was a knock at
his room door one afternoon and voices outside. It
was Haddon and Ames, correspondents out of New
York, and they wanted money. Haddon talked first:</p>

<p>“... He’s off his head and in a mess. He mentioned
your name. He says he sniffed some gas out
in the vineyards somewhere in April, and can’t get over
it. Either that, or the family he’s fouled up with is
feeding him ground glass.”</p>

<p>“Who’s this you’re talking about?” Cobden asked,
though he had heard the name.</p>

<p>“Melton—done some magazine stories,” said
Haddon.</p>

<p>“You say he mentioned my name?”</p>

<p>“His French father-in-law picked on me first,” Ames
put in. “Just happened. I’m at the <i>Charente</i>, where a
lot of Americans are putting up. Told me a long story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
of wrongs to his only child—a female child now married
to Author Melton. Mentioned your name——”</p>

<p>“He was gassed?” Dicky repeated.</p>

<p>“He says he was,” said Haddon. “It’s an operation
case, all right. Melton will have to be cut out of that
French house.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it’s gas in my case or not,”
Dicky said, “but the fact is I am not rightly aboard this
conversation.”</p>

<p>“The idea is to get aboard with some American currency,”
said Ames. “American in trouble—fellows all
willing to help a little. Up to somebody to get the fool
out. Father picked on me——”</p>

<p>“Let me get this straight,” Dicky heard himself saying,
though all he wanted under heaven at this moment
was to be alone.</p>

<p>Ames was one of the best Washington correspondents
in the American press, a fact-getter extraordinary, who
had a semi-inspired way now and then of putting down
his stuff. He was fifty, a friend of John Higgins and
weathered to a fuzzy gray like a fence board. Just now
he bluffed out his embarrassment by speaking of one
of Melton’s stories which Dicky was professionally
familiar with:</p>

<p>“A short story in one of the weeklies—called <i>Dr.
Filter</i>—hell of a good story.... It’s nothing to me,”
Ames finished. “Only the kid’s an American, and he’s
tight up against one of Paris’ prettiest ways.”</p>

<p>Haddon took up the tale:</p>

<p>“The Frenchman’s name is Ducier. Melton’s been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
living at his house—mixed with the daughter—forced
to marry. Now Parent Ducier says the least he can
do is to get a living for himself out of it—hard times.”</p>

<p>“Actually married?” Dicky asked.</p>

<p>“Showed me the passport,” said Ames. “I couldn’t
get a word alone with Melton. He can’t leave his bed.
One of the family always in the room.”</p>

<p>Dicky was straining so hard that he resisted easy
comprehension. It was an intense moment. There
was more talk.</p>

<p>“Of course, whatever you want from me——” Dicky
broke in.</p>

<p>“What you can spare,” Haddon said. “The parents
ask twenty thousand francs, but they’ll take half that
easy. Just now the boy’s too sick to escape.”</p>

<p>“Count on me for at least half of whatever it costs,”
Dicky said.</p>

<p>Haddon’s eyes widened. Ames looked astonished.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard Cobden is rich, Ames,” Haddon explained.</p>

<p>The gray one came closer and examined Dicky’s
face. “I heard it, too,” he said. “You really mean
this?”</p>

<p>“I would give you the amount now, but I understand
that you aren’t sure what it will be. I know
Melton. I’m glad to help, of course.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard you were rich, too,” Ames repeated
slowly. “But I didn’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You’re too good a newspaper man,” said Ames.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
“I didn’t think a man could have real money and be
as good a newspaper man as you.”</p>

<p>Dicky hardly heard the tribute. The two men were
leaving. That was the important thing.... He was
alone. An intermittent geyser was at work within him.
Every few minutes a surge of hot hope boiled up in his
breast. It threatened to deluge him. Out of all the
year’s work was netted at this time one bit of working
knowledge, as Nagar might have called it, that he must
<i>not</i> be deluded by this hope! He tried to cork it up;
failing in that he stood as still as he could in the midst
of the surges. Gradually, he got the thing in hand, but
it was bitter work, this refusing to take the first real
breath of life he had known for years.</p>

<p>He found himself in twilight. The day had slipped
off, while he struggled alone. His forehead was
clammy with the effort going on. To go back into
that dreary hopelessness, and not be able to think out
the reason why! The force that he had to work with
now came from the painful mistake he had made in
working for reward before; from the shock of that
realization in the red room, that underneath everything,
he had counted on his virtue being crowned with
Pidge somehow coming across.</p>

<p>Now the fight changed. Persistently in the depths
of him grew an awareness that he had not done the
full task called of him merely in offering Ames money.
This point became so ugly and evident—that he had to
laugh. More and more, as moments sped on, it faced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
him squarely. He had no sentimentalism to tide him
over; his emotions stayed ice cold.</p>

<p>“But it’s like a fool Sunday-school story!” he
muttered.</p>

<p>Then again the words broke from him: “But living
God, suppose she doesn’t want the bundle back! Suppose
she’s been trying to lose it, and here I am running
after her, saying, ‘You’ve dropped something, Madame——’”</p>

<p>But he couldn’t budge.</p>

<p>Full dark was in the room when he rung Ames at
the <i>Charente</i>:</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking over this thing, Mr. Ames, and
I’m asking a favor——”</p>

<p>“Yes,” came coldly across the town. Ames believed
he was trying to wriggle out of his promise to pay
half.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to the conclusion that this thing is up
to me—the whole business, and I’ll thank you very
much for Mr. Melton’s present address.”</p>

<p>“No. 16, Rue de Belville, Villancourt.” The tones
had warmed.</p>

<p>“Thanks. I’ll report to you presently,” Cobden said.</p>

<p>“Sure you don’t want me—or one of us to go along
with you?” Ames persisted.</p>

<p>“I’ll see what I can do alone first, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXIV<br />

<small>THE HOUSE OF DUCIER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">QUEER drama, from eight to twelve that night
in the little house of Ducier. Four hours—as
long as an uncut opera! The sick man
moaned, and interrupted everything, calling to Dicky
Cobden:</p>

<p>“For the love of God, don’t go ’way and leave me
here! I’m done for, if you leave me alone again....
Oh, Cobden, Cobden——”</p>

<p>The daughter wept. It was her entire part. She
had a brown mole upon her ruddy rounded cheek, and
very white small teeth in gums of a red that Dicky
had never seen before except in dental advertisements.
She was made of little curves, and all of them were
required in the art of her weeping.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Dicky asked her, during a halt
in the proceedings.</p>

<p>“You are taking him away!”</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to be very successful about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you will—you are taking him away!”</p>

<p>Dicky was glad to hear that he was going to get
what he came for, but the obstacles still looked serious.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that what you want—to be rid and paid?”</p>

<p>“My father—yes—but me—no, no! He is my lover—oh,
such an adored!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>It was new to Cobden’s experience just how obdurate
an outraged European can be. M. Ducier
reiterated grimly that weeks ago in this house, he had
suddenly discovered a condition which destroyed all
his past and future. He had forced marriage, but that
did not suffice. Dicky turned to the bed at this point.</p>

<p>“How did you happen to stand for marriage,
Melton?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to do with it—I was gassed!”</p>

<p>Here the daughter’s cries arose, the hands of the
mother were uplifted to heaven, and the face of the
father became more grim. It was against Dicky’s
training and heredity to stand for being bilked, yet
he hesitated to call for help. To start the police at
work would mean the American Legation before he
was finished, and incredible delay. Momentarily Melton
made it harder.</p>

<p>“If you go away and leave me after all they have
said,” he moaned, “there won’t be any need for you to
come back! I am telling you, Cobden, they keep me
here—just as if my legs were tied.”</p>

<p>Rufe spoke in English, which the mother and father
did not understand, but of which the daughter had
plenty to catch the drift. Dicky did not miss the fact
that in the midst of her weeping there were subtle
affairs to confide to her father.... It cost him
eighteen hundred dollars to get Melton clear that night;
but, at least, Melton was thoroughly clear, the marriage
certificate and receipt for heartbalm in full, in his
pocket. He watched curiously now to see if the tears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
of Daughter Ducier were dried—but no, though Melton
spurned her last proffer of a kiss—at least with her,
money was not all.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, Dicky wasn’t able to get
any rest from a sense that he had done well. With
every ounce of his returning strength Rufe Melton
yearned to get out of Paris. He had been abused; he
was frightened to depths hitherto unplumbed. He
lived in a mortal dread day and night that the Duciers
would come for him again.</p>

<p>“I can’t get a passage for you at a moment’s notice,”
Dicky would say. “Besides, you’re not fit to travel for
a few days yet. I don’t want to send you back to New
York looking like a hounded Apache. Let me do this
thing right, Melton, while I’m in on it.”</p>

<p>“But don’t go away and leave me here!” Rufe
moaned. “Let me go out with you when you go.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t have the slightest fear from the
Duciers.”</p>

<p>The hands came up and waved hopelessly.</p>

<p>“You don’t know them! You don’t know her!”
Rufe moaned. “I want to get out of here. I want to
get on the ship. I don’t want to be left alone.”</p>

<p>And this was what he was getting ready to send back
to Pidge! Once, when Dicky was really hard driven,
a sudden chill of rage came over him and he proceeded
this far with a sentence:</p>

<p>“Why, Melton, I really ought to put you——”</p>

<p>The other words—“to death,” he somehow managed
to keep from speech. Dicky suffered especially from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
feeling that he was playing the boob. To be sincerely
in wrong was his pet aversion—dating from the night
of the Punjabi dinner. Besides, he was tortured with
the thought that Pidge Musser wouldn’t thank him.
Surely, for her sake, his mind repeated, it would have
been better even to put old Ames straight, and let one
American meet Paris unaided. But Rufe had called
for him in his trouble, had mentioned the name of
Cobden to the others.</p>

<p>One of the strangest things to Dicky now was that
Pidge’s husband could accept all this—somehow as if
it were his due. Like a family affair. Rufe seldom
spoke of Pidge. Apparently getting back to New
York meant her; apparently they weren’t separated.
Rufe had the most extraordinary sense of taking her
for granted. If he had any money or resources in
Paris, he didn’t let the fact be known. It was Dicky
who purchased his passage for New York. Again
Dicky’s capacity for astonishment was stretched, because
Rufe seemed able to comfort himself with the
fact that he had it all coming. He had never been
sick before. His present infirmity was entirely engrossing.
“I was gassed,” covered all discrepancies
of word and deed.</p>

<p>Back in his room, after packing Rufe aboard the
steamer, Dicky found himself nervous, tired and irritable.
A servant came and took out the extra bed Rufe
had occupied. The place was stiller than ever, after
that—no moaning, no fears, no complaints; but it
wasn’t all relief as Dicky had fancied it would be. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
missed something—the world was so crazy anyway—something
that had taken him out of himself for two
weeks; something at least, that had played upon a
different set of faculties. Suddenly it dawned upon
him, though he couldn’t tell why, that Pidge would be
glad after all. If you play orderly and guardian and
benefactor to a child—of course you miss the wretch.
And Pidge was a woman, and she had said—what had
she said, about there not being two ways? Now Dicky
felt better. There had not been two ways for him.
The chapter was ended at any rate....</p>

<p>Another event of this fall of 1918, so far as Dicky
Cobden was concerned, was the Armistice. You can
tell how inactive hope had become within him at this
time, and within the breasts of tens of thousands of
others, when he hadn’t believed that any other than a
state of war could exist.</p>

<p>And finally, in December, six weeks after the Armistice,
at the time of the greatest rush in history for
trans-Atlantic steamers, when Dicky had about concluded
that the quickest way home to New York would
be around by Asia, a <i>sepoy</i> on leave crossed the city of
Paris from the cantonments in Lourdenvoie, and asked
to see the American at the <i>Garonne</i>.</p>

<p>“You are Richard Cobden?” the young Hindu said,
when the room door was closed.</p>

<p>Dicky nodded, a certain gladness in him that he did
not understand. At the same time he was intent in a
scrutiny of the caller’s face—a youth, but very worn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
Something about the eyes made the American think
of a camel.</p>

<p>“You have been to Ahmedabad, Mr. Cobden?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Might I ask the name of the river there?”</p>

<p>“The Sabarmati.”</p>

<p>“Are you expecting a message from an American
in Ahmedabad?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“From any one there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Now Dicky knew that it was the patience
in the young Hindu’s eyes that made him think of a
camel.</p>

<p>“Is the name Juna?”</p>

<p>“Nagarjuna.”</p>

<p>The soldier bowed. “It is well. I was told to be
assured, before giving you the message. It is this:
<i>That the curtain has risen, the play begun, and that a
seat is reserved for you.</i>”</p>

<p>“Is there need of haste?”</p>

<p>“<i>No haste, but no delay!</i>”</p>

<p>“My plan now is to go to New York——”</p>

<p>“That need not be changed, since it was added for
me to say—that it will be well for you to travel westward
rather than to the East.”</p>

<p>“To Ahmedabad at once?”</p>

<p>“You will do well to go first to Bombay.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Is there anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“Only say to Nagarjuna—that I, too, hope to come
for the end of that play.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“Your name?”</p>

<p>“He knows his messenger. Here I am not a name,
hardly a number——”</p>

<p>“A cigarette—a drink?”</p>

<p>“I will not tarry since it is far to the cantonments.”</p>

<p>The <i>sepoy</i> bowed and departed.</p>

<small>FANNY HEARS THE DRUM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PIDGE MUSSER had moved around in an
indescribable “deadness” for several days following
Rufe’s departure, before it landed on
her, theme and all, that she could do a book. Almost
four years had elapsed since she wrote the <i>Lance</i>. One
Sunday morning after the new work was begun, Pidge
took out the old story from the drawer under the wavy
glass, and glanced over the pages, a puckered smile on
her lips. Then she took the manuscript down to the
kitchen range, and there was a hot fire for a while.</p>

<p>The new writing was not so simple and flowing. In
the first place, there were only Sundays and an hour
or two in the evening; but more than that was the
fact that she had learned so well what stories long
and short are not! She was now in the toil of technic,
which is a long passage. First the freedom of ignorance—“A
man’s a fool before he learns technic,” John
Higgins had said. “He’s a cripple while he’s learning
it. When he’s learned it, and forgotten he’s learned
it—he begins to be a workman. That’s the freedom
of knowledge.”</p>

<p>The old editor didn’t know he had “said it all” for
Pidge Musser that day as he looked up from Rufe
Melton’s story. She wouldn’t forget. Edit and rewrite—some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
evenings with nothing but a torturing inhibition
to go to bed with. There was no other way. She was
tough and broad shouldered. She could toil. She had
an instinctive awareness also, that the deadliest danger
in the whole scheme of things for her, at least, was to
brood inactively. Piled up energy to Pidge meant
inevitable disruption.</p>

<p><i>The Public Square</i> was staying alive under the
energy amassed by the family of trowel makers, but
John Higgins wasn’t standing the punishment of the
days. Pidge saw him falling into the fear of small
things. Among other institutions he hated was the
U. S. Department of Justice, but this department was
hot after him and he was bluffed at last. The climax
had come upon the arrest of a famous pacifist, when
John Higgins was cornered with the necessity of
silence. Since there was no outlet in protest, his venom
turned in on himself. His periods of “illness” were
frequent, and Pidge had a great deal to do. His old
reaction against her marriage was apparently forgotten,
though his temper was unreliable. He was using her
now as never before. Once in a while, he would look
at her long and queerly, and often he said, “I wish
Dicky were here.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In April, 1918, about the same time, a book and
a boy were born in 54 Harrow Street. Pidge was
present at both deliveries. The enactment of the boy’s
coming required a full night; and during the next day,
her activities at <i>The Public Square</i> were remote to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Pidge, who had shrunk so deeply into herself from
nausea and a new kind of fright, that the meaning of
outer events was distorted and ungrippable. John
Higgins didn’t miss the fact. In the drag of the afternoon,
she was called to the telephone—Miss Claes on
the wire:</p>

<p>“You’d better come, Pidge!”</p>

<p>An hour later, between five and six in the afternoon,
she was in the Harrow Street house, looking down
into Fanny’s face which squirmed from side to side.
The eyes moved around the room and finally fixed on
Pidge.</p>

<p>“That you, Redhead?”</p>

<p>“Yes——”</p>

<p>“You was a hell of a long time comin’.”</p>

<p>“I know——”</p>

<p>“That dirty animal hurt me——” Evidently this
referred to the doctor.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. He didn’t mean to——”</p>

<p>“Know all about it, don’t yer? Know all about
everythin’, don’t yer?”</p>

<p>Pidge didn’t answer.</p>

<p>Fanny lay a moment in pallid anger. Then her eyes
slowly opened wider, stretched, filled with astonishment,
part rapture, part fear.</p>

<p>“Why, Musser,” Fanny said in an awed tone, as
one listening to a far sound, “Holy Christ, I’m dying!”</p>

<p>She was the last one in the room to know it—except
the baby.</p>

<p>A queer little dud with his black hair that stayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
combed. No telling what he knew any of the time.
He didn’t open his eyes so that anybody could catch
him at it for several days, but the nurse never would
have done raving over his black lashes. Finally Pidge
heard the news—that the eyes weren’t black after all,
as the hair and lashes would indicate, but a dense blue.</p>

<p>“He’s going to be a soldier—such a soldier!” the
nurse exclaimed. “I know I’ll die when I have to
leave him.”</p>

<p>Pidge’s lips worked without sound, and then a funny
little twisted smile stayed there—that made Miss Claes
love her as never before.</p>

<small>RUFE HURRIES HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">RUFE MELTON came home to find life not
the same. Matters had evolved while he was
away about his country’s business, matters
that didn’t please him now. He had rushed to Pidge.
As the steamer approached New York, a novel and
unforeseen eagerness awoke within to get to her, but
she hadn’t put off her Arctics. Besides, off duty from
her editorial job, there was an infant in her arms for
the most part—a seven-months-old male infant with
combed hair, that had looked into his face and begun
to yell. Rufe took this as a personal affront. He had
supposed it hers at first.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, I forget that it isn’t,” she had said.</p>

<p>Harrow Street furnished the statement and proof,
however, that it was Fanny Gallup’s, who was dead.</p>

<p>“But why don’t you adopt the other two?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Miss Claes has found homes for Albert’s children,”
Pidge said.</p>

<p>Rufe stood it for two days. “This can’t go on, Pan.
I’ve got to get to work—no nerves to work in this
racket, since I was gassed——”</p>

<p>“Of course not.”</p>

<p>Under his surface anger, she saw the old look of
hurt wonder that harrowed her so.</p>

<p>“Come back—any time, Rufe—come whenever you
can. Always a place here, you know.”</p>

<small>JOHN HIGGINS’ CODE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Dicky Cobden reached New York, he
found that Pidge had been called to Los
Angeles, because her father was ill. It was
an evening in mid-January, 1919, and he went at once
to his mother’s house in Fiftieth Street. The strain
of waiting for his home-coming had been almost too
much there. Grandfather had flickered out; his bed
and chairs gaped and would not be comforted. Dicky
went into the living arms, however, and found rest
and gave it. His mother and aunt and sister livened
up like plants, newly-watered. He was queerly astonished
to learn that Pidge recently had called upon his
people—“just a social call,” his mother said.</p>

<p>Outwardly things looked as hopeless as possible at
<i>The Public Square</i>. From his latest retirement to
his rooms for a change of luck, John Higgins had been
taken to the hospital, instead of returning to his desk.
It was a gray-faced old man that Dicky found in the
early morning of his first full day at home, in a room
that smelled of drugs. The face didn’t look at him
squarely. The light hurt John Higgins’ eyes and made
the features writhe. Dicky wanted to move around to
the other side of the bed, so the face would be shaded,
but his old friend was gripping him with both hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“We have been looking for you a long time, Dicky,”
he kept saying.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the unshaven white stubble that changed the
face so much as the quiver of the upper lip, when John
Higgins spoke.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, John?”</p>

<p>“Indigestion—all kinds of indigestion. Damn ’em,
Dicky, they’ve made me eat my own words——”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“The most pestiferous public nuisance ever organized—Department
of Justice.”</p>

<p>Dicky did not need to be warned against the <i>bête
noir</i>. Its shadow was upon John Higgins’ face.</p>

<p>“I rather liked yesterday’s issue,” he said, “and they
tell me that the next two numbers are practically
made up.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been to the office then?”</p>

<p>“No. I called up from home at breakfast. That’s
how I heard you were here. Just off ship last
night——”</p>

<p>“Bert Ames got in three weeks ago. You were a
long time coming——”</p>

<p>“My turn didn’t come—everybody dying to get home
since the racket stopped.”</p>

<p>“Your paper’s alive, Dicky—that’s the best that can
be said.”</p>

<p>“My paper——”</p>

<p>“I’m looking for you to buy the rest. My equity
is on the market. <i>The Public Square</i> is alive, but it’s
not my fault.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“Whose?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they tell you that ‘The Weekly’ was away?”</p>

<p>Dicky looked bewildered. A glint of the old humor
had come back to John Higgins’ eyes, as he added:</p>

<p>“The woman thou gavest me.”</p>

<p>“You mean about Pidge Musser being called to Los
Angeles?”</p>

<p>“Suddenly discovered she had a father who couldn’t
be denied. Ripped out of here on the fifth and left a
hole in every department.... They say I’m done with
the desk for a time. I knew it without them telling
me. I’d have had to wire her to-day or to-morrow to
come back, if you hadn’t turned up.”</p>

<p>Dicky’s thoughts now became busy adjusting to the
fact that John Higgins wasn’t returning to the desk
at once.</p>

<p>“I know when I’m done,” the old man repeated.
“It’s taken nearly sixty years, but I know. You’ve
heard about the serpent that stings itself to death in
captivity?”</p>

<p>“It’s just the chafing of the muzzle, John. You’re
not stinging yourself to death——”</p>

<p>“We all have our little code, Dicky, and I haven’t
been true to mine. Your paper’s alive, in spite of what
I would have done. My code pulled me the other way—against
you—but that little thing stood by your
interests. You’ve got her to thank, not me.”</p>

<p>“Tell me——”</p>

<p>“They were doing things in this country that I
knew about——” the old man shut his eyes, as if in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
nausea—“but she kept me still. Then they arrested
an old friend of mine—man I’ve known for thirty
years—man who loves his country <i>all the time</i>—as I do
not—and they arrested him. One Sunday morning I
wrote my little say about it all, and as I wrote, I heard
them singing ‘Nearer, My God, to Thee,’ in a church
down the block from my rooms. That’s what I called
the article. I was sober. I wrote for all days, and every
year I had lived went into it—all I was. I was willing
to throw you—a little matter of money which you
could afford. I was throwing myself, but I was pleased
enough with the story to show it to her Monday morning,
instead of sending it down to the composing
room.”</p>

<p>The narrative halted for several seconds. Dicky
moved around the bed to rest the old man’s eyes.</p>

<p>“That little tumult had me bluffed from the beginning.
She barred the way to the printer, that’s all.
I thought she was done for when she married Melton,
but she came back stronger than ever.... Barred
the way, Dicky—put her arms across the door. ‘You
can’t do it, John Higgins, you can’t send that down.
It’s just wanton destruction. It won’t do what you
hope. It won’t help your friend, but make life harder
for him and for all the C. O.’s. This isn’t your property
to waste. My heart’s in it and Dicky’s money’s in
it——’ Well, she had her way—and the thing turned
in on me—my own words. My organs of assimilation
weren’t strong enough to get away with it.”</p>

<p>Dicky gripped John Higgins’ shoulder. The old man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
added impressively, “Dicky, I’ve sat at the desk for
hours and studied how I could ever tell you this one
truth! I haven’t written a decent line since that article!
My old side-wheeler doesn’t work—that’s the size
of it.”</p>

<p>He was pressing his hand to the top of his head,
as he went on:</p>

<p>“I’ve studied how I could tell you. It doesn’t seem
quite so hard this morning at the show-down—but she’s
written all the decent stuff that’s supposed to come
from the Desk.... I mean what I said. I’m for sale.
I’ve put it to you straight—the worst. But the paper’s
alive and the books are for you to look at. Times are
getting freer. The next two issues will get out themselves.
It’s all I’ve got——”</p>

<p>“But you can take a leave of absence, and keep your
income——”</p>

<p>“No. That would be a drain. That’s morals possibly,
but not business. I want to sell, Dicky, and what
I ask won’t break you. I thought for a while I was
done for, and I made out my part to her. That would
be simple—but the old hulk still floats—so I have to
have some money.”</p>

<p>Now Dicky dwelt reverently upon the old man’s
secret. Only one thing could have prevented John
Higgins from getting his masterpiece into print; also
John Higgins had made out his single possession in
the world to Pidge—when he thought he was done for.
This thought now electrified Richard Cobden. He
wanted events to turn out this way with such one-pointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
fury that he forgot for an instant that it entailed
the death of his friend. But some time Pidge must have
this gift—some way—John Higgins’ life work! Dicky
arose. The fact that he could do nothing right now
required extraordinary self-control.</p>

<p>“I’ll look the whole property over to-day and tell
you to-morrow morning, John. Be sure it will be all
right for you. We’re——”</p>

<p>Dicky didn’t know what he had started to say. The
old man beckoned him back.</p>

<p>“... Bert Ames can help you for a few days until
she comes back. No better Washington man, anywhere,
but Bert knows the desk work, too.... Wait. I’ve
got to tell you before you go how he dropped in to see
me, day or two after he came back from France. I
asked him if he’d seen you. He rather allowed he had—and
launched into the story of your saving young
Melton from the clutches of the French family.
Couldn’t stop him in time. He hadn’t the slightest
notion that the woman at the desk yonder was Mrs.
Melton.”</p>

<p>Dicky was pale.</p>

<p>“It didn’t knock her out. That’s the queer part,”
John Higgins added. “... Get Bert Ames. There’s
one man who isn’t doing any damage to you as he loafs
around New York.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be back to-morrow morning,” Dicky said.
“Where’s Melton now—Los Angeles?”</p>

<p>“No, here in New York. I’ve heard he’s stopping
at the Vici Club.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXVIII<br />

<small>AN OFFICE OF THE WORLD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DICKY was in the street and it was still only
ten in the morning. The first thing he did
then was to telegraph Pidge of his arrival;
that all was well, and for her not to hurry. He spent
the day at <i>The Public Square</i> offices studying the books,
reading up in the files. He fancied that he found an
aggressive sort of integrity here and there through
the systems, that was familiar. The publishing property
had weathered the war; it was a building base.
Dicky found much that he liked, but fought enthusiasm—fought
back a rush of possessive impulses, until he
was tired.</p>

<p>At six, when he reached Harrow Street, for the
first time, he was not permitted to use the key to the
street door that he had carried so long, for Miss Claes
met him at the basement entrance. He had heard her
voice over the telephone in the morning, but had not
remotely anticipated the stir of feeling that the sight
of her awakened. No emotionless reporter about Mr.
Cobden at this moment. He followed her to the open
fire; the door was shut. They stood together in
silence, and he had never seen her look so well.</p>

<p>“Why, Miss Claes, you are just the same!” he was
saying. “I mean, all day I have been seeing the ravages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
of the war years in the people at home, in John
Higgins, in everybody. But you——”</p>

<p>“Your coming makes me happy.”</p>

<p>Firelight and a fragrant room, and the stillness of
Harrow Street. Miss Claes was speaking of Nagar—of
Pidge—of Pidge and the child—of Rufus Melton—of
Fanny Gallup—of himself—as if they were all
one, all blent in destiny.... Pidge had taken the
child to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>A ring at the street door! Dicky watched Miss
Claes’ face as she left the room, purse in hand. She
returned in a moment with a telegram for him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Welcome home. So glad to hear, so relieved.
Needed here a little longer.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Pidge.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The door shut again.... Miss Claes had heard of
everything—even of his experience with Rufe Melton
in Paris, and from Pidge what Ames had told John
Higgins.</p>

<p>“I should have put Ames wise about that,” Dicky told
her. “It was pretty hard to have Pidge hurt that way.”</p>

<p>“She brought home the news exultingly,” Miss Claes
said. “Hurt, of course—her old sorrow for Rufus
Melton, but a compensating gladness, too. You would
have to be a woman, to feel exactly what it meant to
her. Pidge learned that day that you were close enough
in sympathy to share her work. That was light to her
out of the depths.”</p>

<p>Dicky studied the shadowy face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“Pidge accepts no revelations from the sacred writings,”
Miss Claes added. “Only messages of action
count with her. Your action in Paris freshened up her
life—that you had been brave enough to help her with
her task. And how richly Pidge will pay!”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t hard to do, but hard to know that it was
the thing to do.”</p>

<p>“All that matters now is that it is done. One crosses
a goal, or one does not. The rest is forgotten.”</p>

<p>He told her of John Higgins and <i>The Public Square</i>;
of his talk in the morning and the day with the files.
She inquired regarding details, mechanical and commercial—her
same old rational grasp upon materials.
Of course, he did not speak of John Higgins’ secret,
nor of his own possible purchase. It was a matter of
mercantile tradition in the Cobden house not to discuss
an incompleted transaction; but he told her of Pidge’s
part at the time of the arrest of the editor’s old friend.</p>

<p>“John Higgins calls her ‘The Weekly,’” he added.
“He says it was Pidge who kept the paper going.”</p>

<p>Miss Claes turned to the fire to smile. Dicky didn’t
notice. He was lost in the problem of how John Higgins
could give half-interest to Pidge, and sell it to
himself at the same time.... They were speaking
of India.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ve arranged to go,” he said. “Nagar
promises the story of the age——”</p>

<p>“Nagar sent his message here for you, in case you
did not receive word from the <i>sepoy</i> in Paris—‘No
haste, but no delay.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>He started. This house of Harrow Street seemed
like an office of all the world to him to-night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“... The hardest part is with my people—for me
to go away again,” he was saying, a little later at the
door. “Of course, they can’t understand—my mother
and aunt and sister. Everything looks all right, except
that—leaving them so soon again.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can help a little. I’ll go to them often—while
you are away.”</p>

<p>“That’s quite too good for me to think of,” he said,
and told her of Pidge’s call. “Why, Miss Claes, I
haven’t known what it meant to be rested and straightened
out like this—since Ahmedabad,” he said at last.</p>

<p>Her hand was raised before him:</p>

<p>“Don’t think about it. Don’t analyze. Just—go to
them—and come back when you can. This also is
your home always.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXXIX<br />

<small>SEVEN FLAWLESS DAYS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DICKY was riding westward through the citrus
groves of the last fifty miles into Los Angeles.
Eight days in New York; there had been no
public announcement of a change in ownership of <i>The
Public Square</i>, although John Higgins had retired and
new energies were actively in operation. The old
editor’s faith was gone in himself, but anchored all
the tighter to the son of the trowel makers.</p>

<p>The great Range was crossed. All the forenoon the
air had been clear and cold, but at noon the Limited
had slipped down into San Bernardino, into summer and
fruit fragrance. Now it was two in the afternoon
and Dicky looked out upon one little town after another,
the like of which he had never seen before. Sun-drenched
and flowery towns; breathing-spaces between
the houses and vine-clad trellises; and everywhere the
great orchards, sometimes palm-bordered and often
with rose-covered fences of stone.</p>

<p>“Sit tight, sit tight,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>A hundred times he had repeated this to-day. There
was loose in him a power of feeling which made the
days of his straight unemotional reporting look like
a feeble affectation. Coming into the harbor of New
York less than two weeks before, he had learned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
accept the emptiness of life. But since then, curiously
enough, a new order of content had filled him. Was
it necessary to be emptied of the old entirely in order
to be filled with the new?</p>

<p>Pasadena was behind; the Limited was running down
grade into Los Angeles; then momentary halts with
Mexican faces turned to the car windows—Chinese
faces, a tangle of freights—finally a slow down, and
on one side, groups of up-turned faces, expectant, some
strained to an intense kind of pain to catch the eyes of
their own.... The bags had to be put out. There
were people in front of him; he was shut off from
windows.</p>

<p>“Sit tight, Dicky——”</p>

<p>A white limp-brimmed straw hat pulled down over
her ears like a bonnet! A taller Pidge—no, she was
standing on her toes to look over the shoulders of the
crowd. Now she saw him; her eyes blinked, her
shoulders lifting quickly. He moved slowly, positively
not crushing anybody. Her hands were raised—one
higher than the other, the fingers apart. They stayed
so, until he pressed against them. She was taller.
Their faces were so close—both shaded for an instant
under the wide brim of her hat. He had been looking
into her eyes; then they were too close to look into.
It seemed neither had anything to do about it. He
hardly dared remember.</p>

<p>Some one near by knew a happiness that shrieked.
They walked away from the many voices. Then he
realized that he was carrying his two hand bags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“Where’s the parcel room?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you the way. The station is very old and
dingy.”</p>

<p>He checked them. They walked to the other end of
the yards where the big palms called.</p>

<p>“How’s your father?”</p>

<p>“I think—he’s better. You heard about the baby—Fanny
Gallup’s baby?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I brought him west with me. He’s in Santa Monica
now, so I’ll have to hurry back. You’ll come?”</p>

<p>“To Santa Monica?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Shall we get a motor car?”</p>

<p>“No. The interurban. I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>“Is there a place to stop down there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>“My steamer trunk can wait here for a day or two.
I’d better get my small bags——”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>He unchecked them.... In the city car to the
interurban station, she said: “Oh, Dicky, it’s so good.”
Then after a pause, she added: “We don’t need to
talk about ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I understand.”</p>

<p>“It’s days before your ship?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I can show you around. It’s hard for me not to
be troubled about <i>The Public Square</i>——”</p>

<p>“Everything’s all right there. I’ll tell you everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
when we get on the other car. You’ll like it all.”</p>

<p>“And must you really go to India?”</p>

<p>“I arranged with Nagar, before I left. It’s the story
of the age, he says. After that——”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“After that—New York.”</p>

<p>They were in the Santa Monica car, on the way down
to the ocean. She had shown him Hollywood, pointing
out some of the moving-picture plants.... If
he could only keep calm now—and not rush out to seize
the incredible little attractions of the moment! It
seemed so important to keep calm right now—as if
this were a sort of trial trip. He must be able to move
right into this light without flinching—must endure all
delight in stillness. It wasn’t like repression—this that
was called of him now, but faith. The wonder of it all
was her perfect fearlessness with him. Their old word
came back to him—<i>comrade</i>. He almost spoke it, but
stopped in time. He must live it. But why all this
holding back—after years of holding back?</p>

<p>“... So he won’t be coming back, I’m afraid,”
he was saying of John Higgins. “He understands that
his desk is there for him as long as he wants it, but he
doesn’t encourage any one to believe he’ll use it again.
I told him he could do Washington, and leave Bert
Ames on the desk for the present, but he only shook
his head.”</p>

<p>“I saw it coming,” said Pidge. “Oh, I’ve seen it
for a long time. There was never anything I could
do to help him. I never can really help when I want to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>He felt she was thinking of Melton. She was, but
she was thinking of Fanny Gallup, too.</p>

<p>“He has no relatives,” Dicky went on, “but it’s arranged
for his income to keep up; anything he wants
to do for the magazine——”</p>

<p>He saw her look of sadness.</p>

<p>“John Higgins is so helpless,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“We’ve taken on young Bothwell for the advertising,
and given him a little fund to work with,” Dicky reported.
“Bothwell isn’t a plunger, steady sort of genius
in his game. The idea isn’t to plunge in any department—just
to work softly and slowly and steadily, giving
everybody his money’s worth. Also, if a story or
article just suits, we mustn’t let the price stand in the
way any longer.”</p>

<p>She nodded wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Bert Ames has two or three good ideas to work
out at the desk before he leaves for Washington.”</p>

<p>“But who after that?”</p>

<p>“<i>Sit tight, Dicky.</i>”</p>

<p>... He coughed. “It isn’t like the desk in the old
sense. We have talked about that. Pidge, I’m wabbling
a bit, but the desk is yours.”</p>

<p>They were sitting in the windy front seats. She
appeared to be looking into the back of the motor-man’s
neck.</p>

<p>“When you get back,” he added.</p>

<p>Her eyes did not move.</p>

<p>“This isn’t reward, this is your place; no other can
hold down the job. You’ve done it for months. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
wouldn’t have been any <i>Public Square</i>, if you hadn’t.
I know all about the ‘Nearer, My God, to Thee’ story,
and the editorial paragraphs and how you have kept
up the reviews, and somehow got stories without money
and without price. John Higgins told me everything.
It isn’t giving you reward. It is only going on as you
were, with some money to work with, and two or three
good men to help, and a salary for yourself that will
make up in a small way for the pittance you’ve been
living on for years.”</p>

<p>“There mustn’t be any desk, Dicky,” she said
queerly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean we’d be the laughing stock of New York,
if I perched on a desk, calling myself the Editor.”</p>

<p>She halted, thinking of what Miss Claes had advised
about her authorship of <i>The Lance of the Rivernais</i>.</p>

<p>“You’ll take it, Pidge?” he said with deadly calm.</p>

<p>“I’ll do what I can until you come back. It must be
managed very silently. No announcements. I’ll be
there as I was. I’ve been thinking a lot. <i>The Public
Square</i>—I know how dear it is to you, Dicky. It is
to me, too. It will be wonderful to have some money
to work with. I know about Bothwell. He’s the right
man for the advertising.”</p>

<p>“I left it open—for you to choose the one to help you
when Bert Ames goes over to Washington.”</p>

<p>Her eyes turned to him directly now, searchingly.
There seemed to be something intelligible for him in
them, but he did not divine the meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>“That’ll all work out,” she said presently. “We
mustn’t try to plan it all now.”</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dicky,” she said, “if I’d ever get self-conscious
about feeling all the responsibilities of <i>The Public
Square</i> resting upon my shoulders—I’d muddle the
whole business in a day!”</p>

<p>“They have rested on your shoulders, Pidge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I didn’t stop to think.... In another
minute you’ll be able to see the ocean!”</p>

<p>They were silent. Then she pointed over the motor-man’s
shoulder, and he saw a vast stretch of leveled
azure, like sky ironed out smooth.</p>

<p>“And—you’re—going—across!” she said suddenly—“still
after the Big Story that you’ve always been
looking for. And oh, Dicky, I’ll go to see them when
you’re gone—your mother and aunt and sister.”</p>

<p>“It did a lot for me to learn that you had called.”</p>

<p>“Dicky,” she said solemnly, “when they told me
what you’d done in Paris——”</p>

<p>“Let’s not—Pidge.”</p>

<p>“And when I remembered that Sunday afternoon
you took me to your house—and what a beast I was—oh,
how that hurt! I’ve been so sorry and so grateful.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He had seen Pidge with the baby in her arms. He
had held the baby himself, in fact, while she got breakfast
one morning, and their laughter had disturbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
Mr. Adolph Musser, who felt that the world was no
place for such laughter with his nerves in the condition
they were.</p>

<p>“His back feels so funny,” Dicky had reported concerning
the infant.</p>

<p>Pidge gave him a look, and went on timing the eggs.
Mr. Musser’s egg had to lie three and one-half minutes
in water that had ceased to boil.</p>

<p>“And his hair stays combed,” Dicky added.</p>

<p>He had held converse with Mr. Musser, which was
an experience. Mrs. Rab Gaunt Hastings had gone
her way after a series of such experiences, her fortune
undivided. It had been said that the undivided nature
of her departure was in a measure responsible for Mr.
Musser’s nervous breakdown, though he explained it
metaphysically. Since he could not be left in his weak
state, it was arranged for him to return with Pidge
to New York.</p>

<p>“I have known for many months that the field of
my labors was to be amplified,” said Mr. Musser, with
one of his sudden hopeful flashes. “My illness is but
a cleansing in preparation. Always the wrecker before
the builder. My throat, for instance——”</p>

<p>Pidge called at this point from the fig tree back of
the bungalow. It was their last day.... For seven
days they had walked the sunny silent mesas, traced the
interminable canyons, and miles and miles of curving
shore of the sea. To-night for him, the Valley train
to San Francisco; to-morrow afternoon, the Pacific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
Mail steamer.... She had spoken of Rufus Melton
for the first time.</p>

<p>“You think he was really married in France?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“They frightened him into it,” Dicky said. “It
seemed to me as if Rufe looked upon it as a way out—then
found that they didn’t mean to let him escape,
even then.”</p>

<p>There was no suffocating emotion about this talk.
It was only in moments like this that he understood
that he had earned something through the years. They
had to go back to the bungalow for lunch with the elder
and the child, who objected to each other. There was
only a little while alone in the afternoon, because he had
to be in Los Angeles for his train at six.</p>

<p>“I started things going among the agents in New
York, for a serial,” he said at the last, “but you’ll have
to decide. We want a corking long story, Pidge—one
that has brain and brawn——”</p>

<p>Her face was turned away.</p>

<p>“Just the right one should be lying around somewhere,”
he added.</p>

<p>“I’ll look,” she said.</p>

<p>She would have gone into the city with him, but he
objected: “You would have to come back alone!”</p>

<p>Their real parting was on the Palisades, and there
were few words about it.</p>

<p>“It’s work, now,” he said. “We go opposite ways
for the same job—the Story of the Age.”</p>

<p>“And after that—New York,” she answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>They stood in the superb sunlight at the edge of the
escarpment. Hundreds of feet below was the old abandoned
bathhouse, and the three white lines of surf
pressing into the land, like tireless fingers of a modeler
upon the clay. To the left was the portal of the Canyon,
to the right the fallow lands with feathery brushes of
eucalyptus against the sky.</p>

<p>“We’re all meshed yet, Dicky—meshed in wantings
and struggles, all tracked up with recent experiences.
We can’t see each other clearly yet——”</p>

<p>He was looking into her face in half profile. Quietly
it had dawned upon him that he couldn’t have spared
a single one of the hard days of the past five years, not
a single one of the black patches, even. They were the
dark rooms in which this present striking film had been
developed.</p>

<p>“We can’t—what?” he said strangely.</p>

<p>She was speaking, but still he didn’t hear, for that
moment in the superb sunlight, he saw Pidge Musser
as he had never seen her before.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XL<br />

<small>THE YANK DEVELOPED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DICKY reached Calcutta toward the end of
March, 1919, and had no difficulty in learning
that the Little Man would be in Bombay
within a week. Where Gandhi was at any given time
in the Indian Empire these days was the most public
of all facts. It was as if one entered a house and asked
the children where their mother was. Both the native
and English press were full of his sayings and doings,
though he was seen and heard, of course, from different
angles. The Rowlatt Bills had just been passed, and
Dicky painstakingly looked into the nature of these.</p>

<p>He heard that Gandhi was ill; that he scarcely could
stand, in fact; but that he was speaking to great throngs
every day. A few days ago he had talked to thousands
on the Beach at Madras. Since then he had traveled
to Trichinopoly, to Tuticorin, to Negapatam where he
had addressed a monster gathering in the Nazir gardens,
pledging the people to <i>Satyagraha</i> by thousands,
and warning them with terrible warnings before they
pledged, that the step they took meant self-suffering;
that they must not use violence against the Government
in thought or deed.</p>

<p>Dicky crossed to Bombay immediately, hoping to
find Nagar there. On the train a young officer of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
military who had come from Singapore on the same
ship with him, met an elderly friend of the civil service.
They talked in Dicky’s presence.</p>

<p>“But why don’t they arrest the fanatic?” the soldier
asked.</p>

<p>The elderly departmental officer smiled. “That’s
what they all ask at first,” he said.</p>

<p>“But, if he’s preaching sedition——”</p>

<p>“He is also preaching nonviolence. British Government
hasn’t a better friend in India at the present hour
than this same little barrister. The people are upset
over the Rowlatt Bills, and Gandhi is calming them
down. Arrest him, I think not!... We have much
to thank Gandhi for. He helped along enlistments, and
now he preaches nonviolence. It’s all religion with him.
He’s a political saint. The thousands follow him like a
Messiah. Pretty safe sort of thing, to have a Messiah
around advising the multitudes to turn their other
cheek. Not that we’ve slapped one, you know.”</p>

<p>In the sweltering core of the native city, Dicky found
the house which Gandhi used as headquarters while in
Bombay. Here a letter awaited him from Nagar, written
at Lahore, advising him to look to Mahatma-ji for
counsel; and hoping that they would soon be together.
In his room Dicky sent out for an armful of recent
newspapers and publications, determined to get the
situation further in hand.</p>

<p>... No question about India being a bit stunned
over the passage of the Rowlatt Bills two weeks before.
These measures provided that the ordinary criminal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
laws should be supplemented, and certain emergency
powers added by the Government to deal with anarchical
and revolutionary movements. The shock to native
India lay in the fact that she had been led to expect
that the measures adopted during the War would be
mitigated, rather than intensified at this time. And
Mahatma-ji was on the war path of the Soul.</p>

<p>Gandhi reached Bombay on April third. He was
followed by a great crowd from the railroad station to
the house of his host. Dicky, who had watched from
a distance the emerging of the Indian idol from his
third-class coach, wondered if he were ever again to get
the Little Man alone in a room as in Ahmedabad. He
hadn’t been in the hotel an hour, however, before he
received a message to accompany bearer to Gandhi’s
headquarters.</p>

<p>The native led him through the crowd without difficulty,
and to an inner room where Mahatma-ji sat
alone, both hands extended. Dicky sat down on the
empty cushion before him.</p>

<p>“It is good to see you again, Mr. Cobden.... I
regret that I was not in Bombay when you arrived;
especially since it happened that Nagarjuna was needed
in the north at this time, but we cannot think first of
our own affairs. I am expected in Lahore on the tenth,
but doubtless you will start for there or for Amritsar,
which is very near, before that. Nagarjuna is now in
Amritsar.”</p>

<p>“I will wait and travel with you, if you permit,”
Dicky began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>The other smiled.</p>

<p>“My way of travel is not yours, I am afraid. It
might be interesting enough for just one journey, but
I question the judgment of it. To be seen too much
with me is to become persona non grata to the English.
This would prove a detriment to the work you are to
do. Remember that you are an American, and that
basically the American spirit is above partisanship.”</p>

<p>Gandhi was slightly changed. The wasted body was
even lower on its cushions. The look of intense weariness
was still apparent, but the look of fearlessness was
enhanced. Dicky heard the humming of the <i>charka</i> in
the next room as before. The fragrance returned to
his nostrils. The old feeling stole over him of eagerness
to do something for the physical welfare of the
man before him, something to make the mere enduring
of life easier.</p>

<p>“Physicians tell me that I should be very quiet,”
Gandhi explained with a smile. “It is true that I was
unable to keep all my appointments to speak on the
other side of India, but in the main I am very active.
The human body may be made to do what is required
of it, after a fashion.... Yes, there are many
changes. Our position is rapidly becoming one of direct
opposition to Government. We were slow to realize
these things.... Our movement depends for its
success entirely upon perfect self-possession, self-restraint,
absolute adherence to truth and unlimited
capacity for self-suffering. In this manner only may
we dare to oppose the Rowlatt legislation, and resist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
the spirit of terrorism which lies behind it, and of
which it is the most glaring symptom.”</p>

<p>Dicky’s reaction was queer. He understood the
point about the Government daring to leave this man
at large, but didn’t Government see deeper than this
placid mask? Of all keepers of the peace, Gandhi was
apparently master; but in the fearlessness of the eyes
that gazed on him now, Dicky fancied for a moment,
at least, that he saw what British Government did not.
The Little Man suddenly appeared to him as the living
embodiment of the Enemy to all existing Governments,
utterly terrible in stillness and poise. At the same time,
Dicky didn’t lose for a moment his feeling of pity for
the wasted figure before him, that tenderness which he
could not even have explained to an American.</p>

<p>“... I see you have been faithfully at work, Mr.
Cobden,” the Little Man was saying now. “Some time
I would have you tell me of your days on the French
fields—what you found there after India—whatever
you care to speak of experiences which evidently have
brought you forward in kindness and understanding
and peace——”</p>

<p>“I am glad you find——” Dicky began in an embarrassed
tone.</p>

<p>“It is well for me to tell you, but that is sufficient,”
Gandhi added. “These are our affairs, not yours——”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t understand that.”</p>

<p>“We have a saying that one who is coming forward
in attainment must not delay his progress by pausing
to contemplate or analyze himself. One’s attainment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
rightly is the joy and affair of every other being but
that one.”</p>

<p>Dicky now felt that there was something to report to
America in the story of Gandhi and his following of
millions. For three days he was with the Little Man,
morning and afternoon. Very sternly he had impressed
upon himself the fatuousness of expecting anything like
the old “miracle.” There was no need for that miracle
now, Dicky informed himself gravely and repeatedly,
for something of Pidge Musser ceased to be alive in his
heart at no time, though much pain of yearning was
connected with it and pity and human questionings.
He had learned well by now that all really important
experiences are spontaneous and can only steal into a
mind that is emptied of anticipation and its own inferior
pictures.</p>

<p>But on the third day something came to him—as
fruits from his dreary months of France. He had been
speaking to Gandhi of the hideous directionless campaign
days there. Suddenly, as he himself talked, the
American Soldier in composite was unveiled before him—the
game and grinning Yank, who had held fast in
faith to but one thing under smoke and sun, against
shock and night itself—his sense of Humor, the fun
of the thing.</p>

<p>Dicky <i>saw</i> the Yank, now. That was all there was
to it. In the dark room of France the picture had developed
and the presence of Mohandas Gandhi now
brought it out to the light. It was Dicky’s for all time,
and his eyes closed with pain that his old friend John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
Higgins had missed it—the one thing that one needed
to know, to keep one’s faith in America, and to gamble
even to life itself that the new order of nobleman should
one day arise with laughter.</p>

<p>... He walked the streets of Bombay afterward,
and then wrote to Pidge late at night, though he was
leaving for the north early in the morning. It seemed
he could not wait to tell her. All the meanings of New
York that he had caught as a New Yorker, in his own
home and in the house of Miss Claes, as an exile in
Asia and correspondent in France—fused into a sort of
splendid synthesis at last.</p>

<p>He saw ships coming from all Europe to New York
Harbor—coming in through The Narrows bearing the
emigrants of all Europe—passing under the Statue of
Liberty—tiny seeds diffusing into the vast crucible of
The States, running out from the meeting point of
Manhattan on all the red lines of railroad, into all the
green rivers, planting themselves in all parts, for the
emerging of the New Race at last—the Laughing Men,
the dense physical model of which he had seen in
France.</p>

<small>UNDER THE MANGOES OF CAWNPORE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“NO haste, but no delay.” Gandhi had used
the very words in suggesting that it would
be well for Dicky to join Nagar in the
north. The American telegraphed that he would reach
Amritsar on the evening of the ninth, and made his
way northward leisurely, stopping over in Cawnpore,
for a full day. It was in Cawnpore, toward midday,
after a two hours’ ramble in white dust and the
killing colorless heat, that Dicky halted in the shade of
a little grove of mangoes. He took off his helmet and
mopped his brow with a piece of silk already damp. In
the shade, at a slight distance (his left foot twisted into
the ground), sat an ascetic who kept on with his muttering,
not turning the way of the American.</p>

<p>The look of an iron statue suggested itself. There
were ashes, and worse, in the holy man’s hair, and in
one empty eye socket. The hands were held out in
space—twisted, seared hands, but so moveless that
Dicky thought of the iron statue again. The wrists
were thick and very strong. Cobden squinted his eyes
back toward the pitiless Indian street, and then he perceived
the Hindu’s face turned to him. A single vivid
eye held him, as by the scruff of the neck. The voice
was deep and resonant as from one who had learned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
breathe, a rare art. The words in English were quietly
spoken:</p>

<p>“It is written, my son, that you are to come to the
end of your search within six days.”</p>

<p>Dicky edged closer, and asked courteously: “Do you
really get it that way?”</p>

<p>“So it reads in the crystals. To one who truly reads,
the tale is one—whether read in the crystals or the
stars.”</p>

<p>The holy man lifted from between his thighs a handful
of stained and rusty stones.</p>

<p>“You will go to a wall,” he added studiously. “You
will enter through the gate of the wall——”</p>

<p>“What wall, father?”</p>

<p>“Who knows? I see the wall. The end comes within
six days, and there is tumult.”</p>

<p>“The end of my life?”</p>

<p>“There seems no surety of that, but it is possible.”</p>

<p>The deep voice of the <i>hathayogin</i> went on: “The
crystals foretell, but the wisdom and daring of man
forestall. Had you not come to this tree, there would
be no hope. As it is, you may come again to-morrow
at this time.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, father. Whatever wall it is, I shall
be one day nearer it, to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Few would have noted the faint film of pallor under
Dicky Cobden’s tan. As white men go, he knew something
about the Indian holy men. The more he learned,
the more he respected certain rare types. There is a
saying in India that the real mystic never begs. Dicky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
determined to learn the quality of the man before him,
for he arose now to depart without offering a present
in money.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, father, from this meeting, I shall be wiser
to face the fate that awaits me at the wall.”</p>

<p>“You should be wise enough to take one day from
your journey.”</p>

<p>“I cannot take what is not altogether my own,” the
American laughed. “I am saying good-by now.”</p>

<p>He walked slowly out of the shade of the trees.
With each step, his blood chilled a little, in spite of noon
heat. He thought of <i>The Public Square</i>, of Pidge
Musser at the desk there, of Harrow Street. Death
had to come some time, but life wasn’t boring him just
now. The sunlight of the open stretch stung his eyes
with great weariness. The deep voice called from behind:</p>

<p>“Stay, my pupil!”</p>

<p>Dicky halted and returned, looking down into the
apparently guileless and desireless eye. “Alms for the
temple in Cawnpore,” the lips intone.</p>

<p>“By all means, father,” the other said, no visible
change upon his face, as he placed in the palm of the
beggar several bits of silver from his purse. In the
burning day again, he lifted a tired smile to the sun.
No true mystic, perhaps, but what had this man seen in
the crystals?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XLII<br />

<small>LALA RELU RAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NAGAR took him by the hand at the railway
station in Amritsar on the evening of the
ninth of April, 1919. The need for many
words seemed past; there was quiet gladness. Dicky
took up his quarters in the <i>Golden Temple Inn</i>. Under
the lights at the entrance, as he passed in with Nagar,
groups of Mohammedans and Hindus stood together,
with self-conscious but eager shows of mutual friendship,
and the American rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>If there was one thing in India that could be counted
upon like Government itself, it was the mutual hatred
of these two great divisions of native life. Dicky had
heard in recent days much of the swift breaking down
of these barriers, under the influence of Mahatma-ji,
but he had seen no example of it working out like this
under the lights of the Inn.</p>

<p>“But what do the English think when they see the
Hindu and Moslem <i>kowtowing</i> to each other—as at the
door below when we came in?” Dicky inquired.</p>

<p>“The Deputy Commissioner, the highest English
civilian of Amritsar, looked upon a similar spectacle
to-day,” Nagar said. “I did not hear him, but he is
reported to have remarked, ‘There’s going to be a row
here,’ and drank much cold soda water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“What is your work here, Nagar?”</p>

<p>“I have been working among the students at the college
of Lahore, and now here in Amritsar, working
with the young men and women.”</p>

<p>“Preaching Gandhi’s sort of peace?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Nagar.</p>

<p>“I still wonder that the English don’t ‘get’ the Little
Man, Nagar.”</p>

<p>“The Government regards him as harmless because
he speaks of Soul-force. It deals with precedents;
Mahatma-ji with ideals——”</p>

<p>“You think the Government will arrest him sooner or
later?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Won’t that stop or hurt the work?”</p>

<p>“I remember,” said Nagar, “hearing the school children
in New York sing, ‘John Brown’s body lies
a-moldering in the grave, but his Soul goes marching
on.’ A spiritual beginning never stops. Mahatma-ji
has already brought his few spiritual principles into
matter, into action.”</p>

<p>“Tunnel,” said Dicky.</p>

<p>“Night and day Mahatma-ji has been preparing his
entire people to stand quiet and hateless; no matter
what happens to him,” Nagar went on with a smile.
“He tells them that in the event of his imprisonment,
or even of his martyrdom, they would only wound
his spirit, by answering the shedding of blood with
blood——”</p>

<p>They talked late. For fully an hour after Nagar left,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Dicky sat by the open window, smoking to keep the
insects away. Tobacco did not entirely quench the
stale tired smell of the town. Even after he put out
the light, sleepless hours passed, so it was late in the
forenoon when he awoke, hearing cries in the street
below. He crossed to the window.</p>

<p>“<i>Hindu Mussultmanki jai!</i>” a voice cried. This he
took to mean a native impulse to promote Hindu and
Moslem unity, or something of the sort. Also he heard
the cry repeatedly, “<i>Mahatma Gandhiki jai!</i>” Also
Gandhi’s name associated with the names of “Kitchlew
and Satyapal,” native leaders in Amritsar, of whom
Nagar had spoken last night. Presently there was a
knock at his door. A serious but friendly young
Hindu in student’s garb bowed, entered and walked to
the center of the room, saying in careful English:</p>

<p>“From Nagarjuna I have come to be at the service
of Cobden Sahib for the full day.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Is Nagar busy?”</p>

<p>The student bowed again and proceeded: “My name
is Lala Relu Ram and I am glad to come and make
you acquainted with the disposition of the city.”</p>

<p>The shouts were raised again outside.</p>

<p>“What’s in the air?” Dicky asked.</p>

<p>This was too much for Lala Relu Ram.</p>

<p>“I mean the shouts below—is this another holiday?”</p>

<p>“My people are gravely disturbed. Doctors Kitchlew
and Satyapal have been sent for by the Deputy Commissioner
Sahib. It is feared for them by my people.”</p>

<p>“What have they been doing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“In the terms of public speech they have cried out—also
against the Rowlatt Bills, and for the amity of all
peoples in Amritsar, Dr. Kitchlew being a Mohammedan
and Dr. Satyapal a Hindu, which is anomalous.”</p>

<p>Dicky was still unshaven, and there were some notes
he wished to put down.</p>

<p>“I’ll be ready to go out with you in an hour or less,”
he said. “Would you not like to go down and get a
line on what is going on?”</p>

<p>The student confessed that he would, but plainly
the American idiom “get a line on” fascinated him. He
paused to inquire, and Dicky explained.</p>

<p>“That is very good,” the student observed. “We
are taught that the language of the future is to be made
of most flexible symbols. I will get a line upon what
is in the air and return.”</p>

<p>He was back within a half hour saying that the worst
had happened. Doctors Kitchlew and Satyapal had
been arrested under the Defense of India Act, ordered
to write farewell letters to their families, and been
driven out of town, their destination unknown.</p>

<p>“My people are gathering to go to the bungalow of
the Deputy Commissioner with a <i>faryad</i> (petition)
that will remonstrate very firmly,” the Hindu boy said.</p>

<p>“We had better be there, don’t you think, when the
doings begin?” Dicky inquired.</p>

<p>“Doings?”</p>

<p>“When the performance is pulled off.”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>tamasha</i>!”</p>

<p>“I think so,” said Dicky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>They heard the slamming of boarded shop windows
in all the native streets. The word for suspension of
trade had gone abroad. The two pressed through
gathering groups all making their way in one direction.</p>

<p>They had passed through a stretch of bazaars and
before them now was a carriage bridge over the railroad
right of way. On the bridge, they were packed
tightly in the throng by the railings on either side. In
a moment, the crowd in front halted and surged back.
Lala Relu Ram gripped his arm queerly. Now they
heard voices far ahead—angry voices in English—demanding
the people to disperse. The van of the crowd
had been confronted by a police and military piquet,
but the pressing forward did not cease.</p>

<p>“My people are refusing to be stopped. They claim
the right to make their plea,” the student whispered.</p>

<p>Dicky was sinking himself into the purpose of the
populace. As ever from his training, he sought to
clear his mind of preconception and self-interest—so
that the events might write upon a clean surface. Just
now a shot was heard; a bullet sang overhead—then a
volley. It was not until that moment that he remembered
the dusty twisted ascetic in the mango grove at
Cawnpore. But that was only two days ago, and where
was the wall?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He found himself in the very quick of the Indian
people—under the cuticle of India herself. India the
timid, the terrible; India talking of Soul-force; India
running with its <i>faryad</i> to the ranking English representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
of Amritsar; explaining her griefs and her
hurts to herself and to the English, seeing neither the
humor of her plight on one side, nor its grimness on
the other; India led about on a string which she might
have broken with the flick of a finger.</p>

<p>That was what India had always seemed most like
to Dicky Cobden—<i>hathis</i>, the elephant, gentlest and
strongest of creatures. For many generations she had
been banged about by the shouts and blows of the
white <i>mahout</i>, who was not in the cult of elephant lore,
never a native of her habitat. He had made her stand
around according to his own ideas—India, the great
female elephant, full of tremors and flutterings; of vast
strange delicacies and uncomputable powers....
Now she was leaving her white <i>mahout</i> to follow about
a little black man with an invisible string.</p>

<p>“<i>Mahatma Gandhiki jai! Gandhi Maharajiki rai!</i>”</p>

<p>Dicky heard the voice raised now in the lull that
followed the first volley.... A little black man
with an invisible string, called Soul-force.</p>

<p>One with the crowd, he felt its galvanic jerk of
ugliness pass through himself. The murmur of protest
that now arose from the open mouths was like
something from himself—as if his mouth, too, were
open with sound. A bearded native in soiled white
garments turned suddenly and pressed him back. This
man had felt a stone under his bare foot and he was
making room to reach down to pick it up. Dicky saw
his fingers stretch toward the muck. He understood.
Here was one of the primal impulses of the human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
body in a stress of fear and hate. Far ahead, the
English officers roared commands for the natives to go
back. The voices of native leaders standing with the
English, also implored the people to disperse. But the
people had their <i>faryad</i>. They wanted talk. Also
there were dead and wounded on the earth before the
eyes of the front ranks. Another volley sounded.</p>

<p>Instead of being driven back by the second pelting
of shots, the native crowd crushed its way across the
bridge. In the opening on the other side, it halted, now
in the Civil Lines, no longer jammed by the narrow
rails of the bridge. The throng had not yet become
insensate; no individual had seized the office of leadership.
This was the instant of all to Dicky Cobden, the
turning point. The native gathering might still have
been reasoned with, as it stood leaderless, looking upon
its own dead; but instead of reason, came the third
volley from the soldiers and police, the prod of the
ankus that turned the elephant <i>musth</i>.</p>

<p>The shuddering of revolt that the people felt passed
through Richard Cobden as well—whipped up in his
own breast. Then he was carried forward with the
mob. Nothing gentle or yielding about the bodies
now, a rough, bruising, muscular mass pushed from
behind by incredible power.</p>

<p>Dicky glanced about to look for Lala Relu Ram, and
that instant was whacked to the ground, a slug from
the pistol of one of the troopers, gouging his left
shoulder. He arose to one knee, still turned back, a
laugh on his lips, looking for the student.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>And now a most extraordinary shock was meted out
to the son of the trowel makers. A running native
with gray, patchy face, completely carried away by
mob impulse, halted, stood above the kneeling white
man, struck him in the face with both hands, emptying
his mouth at the same time. Some of the natives immediately
behind, without questioning but that Dicky
was one of the English, now tramped over his body as
they ran. Though fallen, he still preserved a final
waver of consciousness—face down, head covered in
his arms. Finally he was caught by the arm and jerked
to the side.</p>

<p>It was Lala Relu Ram who had pulled him out of
the crowd and looked down into a face covered with
blood and mud, and a welt or two. The only white
about that face now was the lips which smiled and
repeated a word which the Hindu student had never
heard in all his linguistic studies of the East and West.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XLIII<br />

<small><i>HATHIS</i> LAMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DICKY really came to back in an apothecary
shop on the way to the Golden Temple, where
Lala Relu Ram had carried him. The filth of
that face that had opened upon him as he looked up
from his knee—a shudder about that, something he
would never be able to tell. It had been uglier to take
than the blows. As moments dragged on, he fell to
wishing Nagar would come. A curious wonder played
incessantly in his mind about the twisted ascetic under
the mango trees in Cawnpore, but where was the wall?
The crystal gazer had repeated that the thing which
was to befall would be within a wall.</p>

<p>“... The bullet didn’t think enough of you to
stay, Mr. Cobden,” the young English surgeon said
after examination. “It merely bit out a chunk of
muscle and went its way. Since there is no cavity for
it to drain into, it means nothing but a stitch or two,
and a clean bandage. But you’ve been considerably
mashed about the face. There’s going to be a strain
on your drainage system for a few days to carry off
dead tissue.”</p>

<p>He was taken to his room at the Inn, much bandaged,
and Lala Relu Ram sat by his bedside, his face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
often turned to the open window that looked out over
the street.</p>

<p>“I’m all right—don’t stay,” Dicky urged, as he
began to understand the sacrifice of the student in
remaining with him instead of following the mob.</p>

<p>“Nagarjuna did not say for one hour, or for half of
one day, but for the full day,” Lala Relu Ram declared,
“and who knows but that I too might have disobeyed
the orders of Mahatma-ji and become violent?”</p>

<p>Dicky hadn’t much of a grin left, but such as it
was, he was free to let it work under the folds of
gauze. He sent the student below on one pretext after
another, knowing that the young man was exhausting
himself from strain to hear all that had happened.</p>

<p>“It is more terrible than we supposed,” the student
reported, as the long day ended. “Enraged by their
dead and wounded, and being prevented from carrying
their request to the Deputy Commissioner, my people
have burned buildings, bank buildings—the National,
the Chartered, the Alliance banks——”</p>

<p>“That’s hitting them where they live,” said Mr.
Cobden, impelled to Americanisms as never before.</p>

<p>“Sir?” said Lala Relu Ram, bending forward on
the scent of the idiom.</p>

<p>“A Government bank is an English nerve center,
Lala Ram,” Dicky said.</p>

<p>The student was thoughtful, and then resumed: “It
is with sorrow that I have to confess that my people
have forgotten themselves in the case of Mr. Stewart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
and Mr. Scott of the National Bank and Mr. Thomason
of the Alliance Bank——”</p>

<p>“Hurt?” said Dicky.</p>

<p>“Dead,” said the student, with a dramatic pause.
“And that is not all. Miss Sherwood was most brutally
assaulted, and outside the city a railway guard named
Robinson, and a havildar in charge of the Electric,
named Rowlands, were beaten to death where they live,
and the station goods yard burnt——”</p>

<p>Dicky’s eyes squinted under the cloths. “And what
of your own people?” he managed to ask.</p>

<p>“Oh, many have been killed!”</p>

<p>This was an item that did not require the enumeration
of details. <i>Hathis</i> had gone <i>musth</i>, but not for
long. <i>Hathis</i> was horrified at the awfulness of the
thing she had done. <i>Hathis</i> was back in her pickets
again, not realizing her own hurts, anticipating a clubbing
on the toes, and in the immortal way of <i>hathis</i>,
half suspecting that a clubbing was deserved.</p>

<p>“I’d like to doze a little,” said Dicky.</p>

<p>The student rose, but lingered.</p>

<p>“Would Cobden Sahib permit me to ask one question?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, shoot—I mean—ask it.”</p>

<p>“It is about that moment when you fell,” said Lala
Relu Ram. “Rather, it was when I reached you, and
had driven off my people who thought you were one
of the English——”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You were partly out of the body—unconscious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
Yet your eyes were open and you were speaking some
word that I have never heard—several times, as you
would speak the Holy Name in devotion, with breathing.”</p>

<p>“What was that name?” Dicky inquired, pulling the
bandage down farther over his eyes.</p>

<p>“It is not one which I have ever heard in my speech
or yours—that is why I ask. It was like this, ‘Pid-gee—Pid-gee.’”</p>

<p>Dicky laughed.</p>

<p>“That is—the fact is, that’s right curious,” he said.
“I must have been ‘out of the body,’ as you say. That—that
is a little expression we use in childhood!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As Nagar stood under the light that evening, Dicky
saw that his eyes, too, were burning with strange
sorrow. Lala Relu Ram bowed himself out, walking
backward. When they were alone, Nagar came to the
bedside, drawing a chair, and his hand found the
American’s.</p>

<p>“We have not done well in Amritsar to-day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you understand it quite,” Dicky said.
“I was there this noon, at the place they call the Hallgate
Bridge——”</p>

<p>“There was violence,” said Nagar.</p>

<p>“There were three volleys——”</p>

<p>The Oriental smiled. “It is not the provocation that
we deal with, but the losing of oneself in anger. Nothing
remains to us but the fact that Amritsar lost its
self-control.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>“You think the Little Man will be unhappy about
what has happened, when he comes?”</p>

<p>“Mahatma-ji was arrested this morning at Kosi,
served with an order not to enter Punjab, nor the
district of Delhi, but to confine himself to the Bombay
Presidency.”</p>

<p>Dicky studied his friend. He couldn’t help feeling
if Nagar had been at the Hallgate Bridge—— Finally
he spoke:</p>

<p>“I’m just a reporter, Nagar. I’m not granting that
Gandhi knows it all or that the natives to-day are all
right, and the English all wrong. Still, I can’t help
wondering at what you ask of your people—as a reporter
would ask, you understand. They turned the
other cheek! They took the first volley and the second.
I was there. No man has three cheeks. I saw it all
in that minute between the second and third firing.”</p>

<p>Nagar’s hand pressed his and Dicky lowered his
voice, though his tone had not been loud.</p>

<p>“Anything might have happened that instant had
there been a bit of leadership,” he added. “The people
wanted to talk to their father—the Deputy. You would
have wept for their forbearance, or stupidity, as you
like. Their dead were at their feet, the cries of the
wounded in their ears, and still they weren’t maddened.
They only wanted to show their <i>faryad</i>. If there had
been the right Englishman on the spot—why, the crowd
would have been allowed to go forward with its document.
I’ve an idea that it was something dangerously
like funk that caused that third volley, and that nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
will ever be so sorry for what happened to-day, as
England herself. I call it human the way your people
lost their heads.”</p>

<p>“Mahatma-ji’s ideal isn’t human, Richard. It is
of the Soul. We shall suffer and India shall suffer—for
to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a lot to learn about this man’s India. I can
see that,” the American said queerly.</p>

<small>THE SLATE AND THE SPONGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PIDGE was choosing a serial for <i>The Public
Square</i>. The choice lay now between two
manuscripts on the desk before her eyes. One
was by a maker of the “new” American literature,
named Carver, who had dared to perform the work in
one sustained, slow movement, bound to ward off
excessive popularity, a thing of drabs and tans and
grays, but earnest, even in its hopelessness. It consistently
portrayed a cross section of life, a fine piece
of human observation, but altogether unlit with intuition.</p>

<p>The other book was a novel of New York, by a
woman whose name was entirely unheard of. This
manuscript had been refused several times as a serial
in the past year, and several times as a book prospect.
The letters of refusal from the different editors were
also on Pidge Musser’s desk. One said, “This book is
too much of a gamble for an unknown name.” The
united opinion of all professional readers was that this
story was unquestionably an augur for the future of
the novelist, rather than a compelling announcement of
her arrival.</p>

<p>In her own heart, Pidge believed that the woman’s
story would interest more readers than Carver’s. Also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
<i>The Public Square</i> would be saved considerable money
in taking the woman’s story, for Carver stood out for
rather a high price for his first American serial rights.</p>

<p>“It isn’t the freedom of ignorance,” she said at last,
about the lower-priced book, “but it isn’t the freedom
of knowledge, either. ‘A man is crippled while he’s
learning technic.’... No, I can’t take the chance!”</p>

<p>So the novel by the unknown woman went back to
Harrow Street with its refusals, and found a resting
place in the drawer under the mirror that waved; and
only Miss Claes and the author, herself, knew who was
hurt.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Adolph Musser, in New York with his daughter,
began to have callers. The two small upper rooms
in Harrow Street were not adapted for callers, even in
the adaptable Village. Especially this was so because
an adopted male child of one year was rooted and
ramifying in the place. One of the ramifications was
a female lodger and one-time nurse who looked after
the child while Pidge was away at the office. Mr.
Musser, during his first week in New York, before he
found an apartment in the Sixties, had pronounced this
woman too heavy-footed to live with.</p>

<p>Though Pidge had received an important increase of
salary, dating from the first of this year of 1919, she
did not find herself in a greatly improved condition
when the additional expenses of nurse and her father’s
separate maintenance were considered. However,
something happened which she had not foreseen. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
Adolph Musser became rapidly self-supporting. According
to his predictions, New York proved to be
suffering from a “biological hunger and thirst” for his
very sort of metaphysic. Los Angeles had been sated.
One had merely to move from temple to temple in Los
Angeles. Cultists of all colors were there; light-bringers
from all lands. Mr. Musser, according to
predictions, found New York a virgin oil field and he
was not long in getting his derricks up.</p>

<p>Late in May there was a letter from Richard Cobden,
mailed at Bombay in early April. Though it was
written to Pidge personally she saw in it Dicky’s first
real work, his first actual grasp and retention of
essentials, to her idea. It opened to her, also, the lineaments
of the Big Story they had talked so much about.
She read the letter through twice on the day it arrived,
and that night took it home to read to Miss Claes, who
came to the upper room in the latter part of the evening,
as she had come to hear <i>The Lance of the
Rivernais</i>, over five years ago. Their faces were close
together, and Pidge read low and rapidly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been with Gandhi several times in the past
three days, and early to-morrow I start north for
Amritsar to join Nagar. I hadn’t thought of writing
this until just now, on my way to bed, and the subject
of the Little Man suddenly filled me. I feel an unadulterated
American to-night, and there may be an
advantage, at least an angle, in a study of Gandhi from
that point.... He is very ill, can scarcely stand,
but more than ever full of his kind of light and power.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
In the last three days with him, I have come to understand
<i>you</i> as never before—and America and the
American soldier. I have found out, Pidge, what you
mean by stating and living the fact, that it isn’t how
much one knows that counts, but how much one does.
Gandhi is a doer. I used to hear in church something
about the Spirit being made flesh, and now I’ve got an
inkling of what that means. Gandhi’s genius doesn’t
dream. <i>It does.</i> The sun shines on all India, but
Gandhi has become a lens. The rays focalize through
him. The ground burns under his feet.... He is
called a bigot, a fanatic, a living Blue Law, and it is all
true, Pidge. He is drawn in black and white. He has
no half-tones, no twilights, no afterglows. He is devoid
of atmosphere as the moon. His lines of light and
shadow are never blent or diffused. He is vivid noon
where his light strikes, densest night where light ends....
It is not that he loathes the West, but that he
knows the East. He has become a specialist, as Nagar
says repeatedly. He has withdrawn his attention from
the world to India, Herself. He has brought in his
eyes from the future, to the Now. He sees the next
step which India must take, and leaves to the dreamers
of the world to point out the glories and the penalties.
He stands in the road in front of India to-day, like a
man before a runaway horse——</p>
</div>

<p>Dicky had ended the letter suddenly, saying he was
sleepy, but had more to say later. The two women
talked low, because of <i>another</i> in the room. This other
was not to be disturbed. They stood over him now.
He would not have approved at all of their gayety and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
know-it-all manner, had he been awake. His lids were
down, however; the black curving lashes reposed in
their hollows; the world, which was the big horse he
must some time ride, was away minding its own business.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear this much before I go——” Miss
Claes stopped and took both of Pidge’s hands.</p>

<p>“Before you go—where?”</p>

<p>“This little slate of Harrow Street is all written over.
It is to be rubbed out now, Pidge. My part is finished
here—I don’t know how well, but it’s finished. I am
leaving New York.”</p>

<p>“Why, that—that seems—insupportable!...
Why, I thought anything could happen but that—to
my New York!”</p>

<p>“Only you are to know, dear,” Miss Claes said
moments afterward. “Yes, it is India——”</p>

<p>“To Nagar—you are to be with him—the Hills!”</p>

<p>“Don’t, Pidge. It isn’t for words——”</p>

<p>“Forgive me——”</p>

<p>“These are terrible days for India. It means work—work—tests
for every one’s courage. Little Harrow
Street is still and steady, compared.... But this is
dear to me—the thought that I go ahead to make
ready for you another place to come——”</p>

<p>“My upper room,” said Pidge softly. “My upper
room.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XLV<br />

<small>AMRITSAR, APRIL 13, 1919</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TOWARD the end of the afternoon of Sunday,
the 13th, Richard Cobden ordered a carriage.
He was still bandaged about the head, his left
arm in a sling. This was his first descent from the
room since his hurts on the 10th, and meanwhile General
Fyatt had taken control of the city, bringing in
troops from nearby stations. Dicky had met Fyatt in
France, and was on his way now to pay his respects
to the General at his Headquarters in the Ram Bagh.
He was getting it very clearly just now that if it were
observed that he had any sort of affiliation with the
natives, he would promptly be placed out of reach of all
Punjabi events, even as a spectator.</p>

<p>The American was personally and intensely interested
in Nagar and Gandhi, but still he did not feel
that he had taken sides in the least. He looked upon
Gandhi’s work as visionary, and the work of the British
in India as substantial, and the more likely to endure.
He had seen Nagar but a moment or two each day
since the 10th, and had kept in touch with developments
through the English sources.</p>

<p>The air was still furiously hot, though it was after
four in the afternoon. The streets were crowded, this
being the day of the <i>Baisaki</i> fair, and thousands were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
in from the country. Dicky heard the roar of a ’plane
over the city, and craned out of the window of his
half-closed carriage for a glance at its flight. The pilot
was making circles over a point at a little distance
ahead—a low peculiar hovering.</p>

<p>Dicky inquired of his driver the meaning, and was
told that the ’plane appeared to be hanging over the
great crowd assembled in the Jallianwalla Bagh—that
thousands of the visitors attending the fair were there,
listening to the speakers, as well as many townsfolk.</p>

<p>“But didn’t the General give orders for no public
assemblies?”</p>

<p>The driver had not heard. Dicky reflected that the
’plane didn’t appear to be there for the amusement of a
crowd—no circus ’plane, but an effective bit of government
property, rather, with an air of business. It rose
now and vanished over the city.</p>

<p>The carriage continued on the way to the Ram Bagh,
until it was halted for the passage of troops in the
street. A half-hundred Gurkhas and Baluchees, two
motor cars with English officers and civilians, the whole
outfit trailed by a pair of armored cars, and moving in
the direction where the government ’plane had hovered.</p>

<p>“Where are they going?” Dicky asked of his driver.</p>

<p>The man was not sure, but suggested the Jallianwalla
Bagh.</p>

<p>“What is that place?”</p>

<p>“It is a <i>maidan</i>,” the man said, “a big open square, a
public place.”</p>

<p>“Public square,” Dicky muttered. “Turn in short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
after the armored cars,” he commanded the driver.
“Follow close.”</p>

<p>“Ram Bagh is not so.”</p>

<p>It is a difficult proceeding, requiring formalities, to
alter one’s orders in Asia.</p>

<p>“Listen. I am changing my purpose. Not Ram
Bagh, but Jallianwalla. Turn in after the soldiers—now!”</p>

<p>The driver obeyed, but was hurt and murmuring.</p>

<p>To Dicky, that afternoon, Amritsar was a place of
heated and offensive stenches. As they passed through
hot and narrow streets, certain of these odors startled
his comprehension, because they were so subtly vindictive.
The thought occurred to him, as he watched the
naked children playing in the wet shadows, of what a
correspondent had remarked in Cawnpore: that it was
hard to tell whether the streets soiled the children, or
the children soiled the streets. The movement forward
was very slow, and Dicky bent to inquire at length if
they were still moving toward Jallianwalla Bagh.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is very near,” said the driver, churning at
the lines with both hands.</p>

<p>The American did not let himself think further. He
fell into his old queer absorption; the reporter of his
makeup taking him over. He shut out Amritsar from
mind; the Native Idea, the English Idea, and his own
that hovered between. He was just a stranger in a
half-closed carriage looking out from under a bandaged
brow. He heard the flies in the air. He did not seem
to have any mental guard to shut out that distracting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
buzz—flies winging across the vapors of filth. They
came to a narrow lane, a <i>kucha</i>, the driver called it.
The armored cars ahead were having difficulty in this
constricted place. Finally they halted and Dicky heard
a British soldier on the nearest turret call out that the
cars could proceed no further.</p>

<p>His own carriage was of course blocked. The <i>kucha</i>
appeared less than eight feet wide. He was still lame,
and had not intended to do much walking about in the
furious heat, but beyond the armored cars he had
glimpsed the Gurkhas filing forward and the officers
stepping out of their machines. He let himself to the
ground, ordered the driver to wait, and followed the
soldiers through the wet trampled lane.</p>

<p>A minute later he was in the broken ranks of the
Gurkhas—little muttering men with big sprawly hands
holding fast to their rifles, fingers running loosely over
breech and stock and barrel. The halt had come because
there was a sudden rise to the ground—a mound
of earth closing the lane, and running at angles to each
side. The soldiers were ordered up and deployed along
the mound; equally divided to the right and left.</p>

<p>Now Richard Cobden, in the midst of the officers
and civilians who had occupied the two motor cars,
also gained the eminence with some pains; and at this
point he saw the man he had started out to find that
afternoon—General Fyatt, a significant picture, indeed,
here in Amritsar, who had been but a small obscure
exhibit in the broad gallery of France.</p>

<p>Fyatt didn’t see him, and the American looked over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
the vast assembly of natives in the burning light. On
a raised frame toward the center, a Sikh speaker stood.
Dicky could hear his words, but did not understand.
He saw, however, that the coming of the soldiers had
interrupted the tenor of the speech and that many of
the people were frightened and drawing away. An
English officer beside him, after listening a moment,
spoke with an ironical laugh:</p>

<p>“<i>We have nothing to fear. Sarkar is our father and
our mother. Government would not injure its children</i>——”</p>

<p>Dicky realized that the young officer had quoted a
translation of words the Sikh speaker had just spoken
to the people—from twelve to fifteen thousand in the
<i>maidan</i>, he reckoned. All faces were now turned to the
soldiers—waves of faces. It was as if the color of a
tree had changed by a steady pressure of wind that
showed the under side of all the leaves. A nervous
laugh from the young Englishman who had interpreted;
then from General Fyatt, the low single
sentence:</p>

<p>“You may give the order.”</p>

<p>“Fire!” the young officer called to his Gurkhas.</p>

<p>To Richard Cobden it was quite incredible, but
another officer on the far side of the lane repeated the
command, and the line of leveled rifles spurted on either
side. Dicky winced at the crashes. He had been in
the firing pits many times, but one can never remember
how these concussions close by hurt one’s head and
spine.... Of course, they were firing blanks. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
was Martial Law. The people had been ordered not
to assemble and they had disobeyed—twelve thousand
of them, or more. General Fyatt had undertaken to
impress upon them that his word was Law, Martial
Law. Of course, this was also the English answer to
April 10th, at the Hallgate Bridge. A bit uncouth to
stampede a big crowd like this.</p>

<p>Surely Fyatt couldn’t have realized what this firing
of blanks would mean.</p>

<p>They were trampling themselves to death already.
This wasn’t English humor. It was more like the
fool who yells, “Fire!” in a packed theater.</p>

<p>The great open place was walled. There were no
broad exits. The several narrow vents had locked of
themselves by the pressing of bodies against them.
“Why,” Dicky thought, with a wrench and shiver at
the sight of the monster throng in the process of
constricting itself, “why, this is a womb of death!”</p>

<p>Cries were sustained at the end of this April holiday—cries
of battle and accident and pestilence, the
cries from a great ship going down.</p>

<p>Dicky thought of a pot beginning to boil. He
thought of a yard of leaves suddenly caught in a
swirling wind. He thought of all the old stale similes
used and over-used since bloodshed began, and his
mind sank back in the hollow of hopelessness. It
couldn’t be told, but his faculties tried again and again,
even though his heart sobbed with the people.</p>

<p>A great square of colored cloths in the sunlight—from
twelve to fifteen thousand human beings listening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
to a man who cried out against violence, who cried out
that <i>Sarkar</i> couldn’t hurt his children—suddenly being
ground in the great crush of Fear, being sprayed with
rifle fire—blanks, of course—but to a result almost as
deadly, for the people were destroying each other. They
didn’t mean to, but they were trampling each other to
death. Thus his mind viewed and reviewed—all this
in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Cobden saw something he didn’t understand.
Down in the <i>maidan</i> on the ground, not fifty
feet away—a giant Sikh in white turban, running forward
with raised hands, like a messenger—a close-up
possibly for Dicky’s eyes alone—suddenly halted, spun
and slapped limply to the ground with a curving fling.
A glorious fall, if it had been a bit of acting—the fall a
man makes when a bullet hits him.</p>

<p>But Dicky was quite possessed with the idea that the
soldiers were firing blanks.</p>

<p>At this point, an English officer roared at his
Gurkhas, who apparently had been firing high. His
words were in vernacular, but the American saw the
little dark men shorten their range.</p>

<p>Thus it dawned upon him slowly, as if he were a
very stupid man, that Fyatt was punishing Amritsar
indeed—in fact, that the General was making a day of
it. Also at the same time it dawned upon him that the
public square was walled. He had seen the wall before,
partly formed of buildings, but it hadn’t properly registered
in connection with the words of the twisted
ascetic of Cawnpore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>Now he knew also that the several narrow throats
of the walled square, none so wide as the <i>kucha</i> through
which he had entered, had become points of intensified
death, because the great throng had divided to crush
itself against these impossible apertures. The English
officers appeared to be directing the fire of the soldiers
toward these points where the maddened masses were
most dense.</p>

<p>Almost directly across the square the wall was low,
less than six feet. Hundreds were jammed against it,
but their bodies were so locked by the pressure from
behind that no one could climb or be pushed over into
safety.</p>

<p>The Gurkhas looked like monkey men. They
stamped queerly as they pumped. They were being
told what to do and were in a great concentration to
obey exactly. They emptied their magazines, each
man taking his own time, and halted to fill them again,
carefully avoiding with their fingers the burning metal
of the barrels, as they refilled and fired.</p>

<p>An English civilian, an elderly man, face livid,
bumped Cobden’s wounded shoulder, as he lurched past,
muttering:</p>

<p>“My God! I can’t watch this.”</p>

<p>Another Englishman followed him, venting an hysterical
laughter—both faces Dicky had seen in one of
the motor cars. For an instant it seemed the only sane
action left in the world—to rush out into the lane the
way he had come, as these Englishmen were doing, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
cover face and ears, to rush forth, to continue to the
ends of India and the uttermost parts of the earth.</p>

<p>Dicky started to follow, but turned back.... No,
he wouldn’t rush off to be sick. This was the wall that
he was to come to. It was something else.... What
was it? Oh, yes, it was the Big Story that he had been
pacing up and down the world to find.... Of course,
it would be like this. He would find himself in the
midst of it, without knowing at first.</p>

<p>He ducked forward under the rifles of three <i>sepoys</i>
to reach the staff. He couldn’t go away without paying
his respects to the General. Was not this what he had
started out for to-day? He stumbled over a soldier on
his knees—a Baluchee, vomiting with all his might.
He saw Fyatt a few paces forward—Fyatt, grizzled,
square-shouldered, behind a field glass. A mocking
laugh rose in Richard Cobden’s heart. A man didn’t
need a field glass to cover the <i>maidan</i>. One could see
the faces; one could see the fallen; one could see the
writhing cords of human bodies. Oh, no, one didn’t
need a field glass. One could see the thousands on the
<i>maidan</i> now—as one up-turned face, the face of a
child betrayed, but unable to believe. Fyatt merely
chose this way to cover his own face. His back looked
stiff and blocky as he swung slowly around behind the
glasses. His shoulders and neck didn’t move. He
turned from the hips, Dicky perceived, as he touched
the General’s sleeve.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XLVI<br />

<small>THE HOOKED MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A &#160;NOTE of unison had come to the great cry
from the people at this moment—one note that
tugged at the white man’s soul—the deadly
hurt of a child.... General Fyatt was not tall for
a soldier, with square lines of figure; square of chin
and temple and shoulder and elbow, pivoting on his
hips. But there were two remarkable curves in the
ensemble, the sidewise curve of the hooked nose and
the bow of his booted legs. Now as the American
stood by, a new key presented itself to the man—that
hooked smile. It opened other hooks—hook of the
eye-corner, as well as the corner of the mouth and the
bent nose, hook of the fingers on the field glass. The
face turned to him—a white welt from the glasses on
the bridge of the nose.</p>

<p>Dicky felt the horrible slowness over everything—that
somehow there was not in this man’s volition the
power to order the firing to cease. No recognition
showed in Fyatt’s eyes. He stared. It was like the
man who had stared at him on the docks in Bombay,
when he heard that America had entered the War.</p>

<p>“Well, sir!”</p>

<p>Dicky felt rebuked. Then came to his ears again
the terrible drowning cry of the children, and he saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
Fyatt differently—not as England; at least, not all of
England—a black crooked finger operating merely—the
face of England turned away.</p>

<p>“I only wanted to ask——” Dicky stopped and
raised his voice above the tumult of shots and voices.
“Cobden of New York—saw you in France!”</p>

<p>It was utterly ridiculous to yell one’s identity. He
had forgotten that his face might look different under
a bandage. The field glass that had been partly raised
again was whipped down. The hooks tightened.</p>

<p>“Ah, Cobden. Heard you were in town. Busy, you
know!”</p>

<p>“I see!” the American yelled back. He felt like a
maniac. “I see! I merely wanted to ask, General,
if you had gone mad—or have I?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A young officer ran between them reporting that the
ammunition was running out.</p>

<p>“Sixteen hundred and fifty rounds, sir. Mainly used
up. Some of the men finished——”</p>

<p>“Ease them off back to the armored cars. Let the
others finish firing—fire low.”</p>

<p>“Not much wasted—only at first, sir!”</p>

<p>Fyatt turned to Cobden, shouting staccato sentences:
“Didn’t catch what you said. Teaching Amritsar a
lesson! Plover says we ought to take a thousand for
one! Teach them to assault women——”</p>

<p>“Isn’t the lesson taught?” This time Dicky didn’t
yell.</p>

<p>“They haven’t dispersed yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“Dead men can’t disperse, General. The rest can’t
get out——”</p>

<p>Dicky walked away. He had looked again at the
<i>maidan</i>. Everything was overturned. The thousands
were prone or kneeling.... If one steel rifle bullet
plows through sixteen inches of oak—how many human
bodies will it plow through? How many will 1650
steel bullets?... No shots wasted since the first
minute or two. They couldn’t be all down—wounded
or done for. Suddenly Dicky realized that many of
the people were now praying. He was back at the head
of the lane, moving in circles like a man who has been
beaten on the head.... A black-coated Englishman
with a clergy’s vest, grasped him by the arm,
peering into his face—eyes gone utterly daft. He
shook Dicky’s arm and pushed it from him; then ran
to a soldier near by and peered again.</p>

<p>“Tell it to the General,” Dicky called absurdly, but
his words weren’t heard.</p>

<p>Now he saw one of the elder civilians who had
escaped a few moments before, coming back. This
person scrambled upon the mound from the lane side
and inquired of the earth and sky:</p>

<p>“I say—can’t he stop?”</p>

<p>“He’s dispersing the people,” Dicky answered.</p>

<p>The firing was desultory now. He heard orders for
it to cease entirely.</p>

<p>“We might need a cartridge or two in the streets
going back——” a voice behind him said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“We’ve got the armored cars——” another answered.</p>

<p>Then Richard Cobden happened to look at the west
and found the sun still high in the sky. This struck
him as altogether peculiar.</p>

<small>IN THE WARM DARK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">COBDEN found himself in the lane, turned
away from the <i>maidan</i>, his hands lifted and
clenched. From behind still came the sounds
of a ship going down—all but down, the firing ceased.
In front of him, the <i>sepoys</i> were running low as if to
escape. It made him think of ball players leaving the
field in the summer dusk after a game, running through
the crowd to the clubhouse. The armored cars were
backing out before him.</p>

<p>“... Of course,” he kept telling himself, “it
had to come this way—end of the old story, the beginning
of the story of the age. This isn’t an English-Indian
story. It’s a story of all the world.”</p>

<p>Only natives were about him—ashen-lipped, muttering,
frightened, dazed. He continued through the
<i>kucha</i>, following the armored cars. He must get to
the hotel. He had something to write, copy to file.
But this delusion did not carry him far, before its
absurdity struck home. The outer world would never
hear of this story, until it leaked through by letter or
word of mouth. The cables had been tight before.
They would be drum-tight now.</p>

<p>Vaguely and dully he realized that all things were
changed for him for all time. The reporter in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
makeup that had blithely set out for Jallianwalla Bagh
was done for, all aloofness of the spectator gone—the
little poise of ego which had carried him so well and
so long, so far as associations with men went, up and
down the world until this hour—that ego poise was
leveled and smeared. Amritsar’s public square—the
massacre in the <i>maidan</i> had cloven him, and into the
opening all India had rushed. The face of the hooked
man came back to him—hard unto silliness, the English
stare against the sinking city.</p>

<p>He had overtaken the nearest of the armored cars.
He looked upon them strangely, their sleek integration.
They had not been needed; India had died and been
born again without them. Something similar had
happened in himself. No casual reporter now—one
living emotion, rather—one fire, one fury, a burning of
unqualified pity in every cell that held his life.</p>

<p>The driver of his carriage hailed him. Cobden lifted
his hand in return, but halted. Suddenly he realized
that he didn’t want to go back to the <i>Golden Temple
Inn</i>. The thing alive in him now was bigger than a
story to be written, bigger than the finding of a free
cable, which was not in India. He paid the driver and
stemmed his way back against the people that thronged
the lane. He knew now that he must keep his mouth
shut in an altogether different way; that a new life,
terrible in its potency, had seized upon him, was somehow
being born in his flesh and brain. He must hold
still—hold still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“Sixteen hundred rounds in ten minutes,” an English
voice reiterated.</p>

<p>Dicky’s head bowed under his helmet. He was slow
to believe that the firing had lasted only ten minutes.
It amazed him now that this was still a world of hot
daylight. He looked back upon his coming through
this lane as one does upon the last memory before a
great sickness. He had to memorize and register again
and again upon his faculties that he had alighted from
his vehicle only fifteen minutes ago, and this was all
one day, all one afternoon, all one quarter of an hour.
In the interval there had been death and birth for
India and for himself—a mysterious conception, at
least.</p>

<p>“God forgive me for losing my head,” he muttered,
for there was something in him that still counted
losing one’s head as the first moral offense. He was
thinking of the moment standing before Fyatt. He
would move very quietly now. As he reclimbed the
mound where the <i>sepoy</i> firing line had stood, it came
to him that a man might lose his head for a moment, at
least, to find his heart.</p>

<p>He let himself down from the mound to the bloody
ground. There he found presently a man wedged
under the bodies of two already dead. He dragged this
man loose, only to find that he was apparently bleeding
to death from a shattered knee. He unwound a turban
from one of the dead men and wrapped the wound,
knotting it tightly above the flow of blood. His own
left hand was impeded by the sling. Presently, he freed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
it entirely, his personal scratches appearing ridiculous
in this broad field of bloody men. Thus began his
work. It was as if he had entered single-handed upon
a task to alter the sewerage system of a city.</p>

<p>There were no English about, no police or native
soldiers. Martial Law had done its part and gone to
supper. The people flocking into the <i>maidan</i> with
moanings and horror-stricken cries now were those
looking for their own. From the farthest parts of
Amritsar they were drawn, from many houses to which
one or more did not report for the evening meal. Living
men and women—hurrying, bending—hands reaching
down, hands pressed to faces—the quick and the
dead.</p>

<p>A while afterward he looked up to find that the sun
had gone down. His knees were wet with blood. He
felt the wet spreading heat upon his left shoulder. His
wound had opened from exertion—a smile at that.</p>

<p>He had worked a little on battlefields before, but
they weren’t like this. A persistent thought held him
that this was the field of his own dead! He didn’t
understand how his brain could deal with such weird
stuff. He concluded that he was in a half-dream where
thoughts appeared veritable that wouldn’t hold water
when he fully waked.</p>

<p>Now he had extricated from the mass near the
Hasali Gate the body of a trampled girl child. She
was warm, possibly not dead. She smelled of the
earth and tears.... His heart thumped, and pity
like a warm breath surged through him—pity, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
some one said was the pain of love—oh, yes, that was
Miss Claes’ expression. He touched the girl’s long
coarse black hair in the thick twilight.</p>

<p>His lips formed with explanations and thoughts as
he worked—the things he would tell Pidge, the way he
would tell these things to Pidge. He placed the unconscious
one down at the feet of a native doctor who
was binding wounds, but often raising his eyes to
heaven in prayer that the soldiers might not come
back.</p>

<p>Dicky stood up in the warm dark, lifted his helmet
and mopped his forehead with his grimy right hand.
He could actually smell what horses smelled (as he
remembered in France and Arabia) when they snorted
and ran aside.... The dead would never end—hundreds
of dead—public square covered with dead.
And what was pulling at his brain—something trying
to gain admittance? He had it now. Pidge Musser
was close again; close as she had come in the <i>Ashrama</i>—not
weeping, horrified, not in the least dismayed or
hopeless by all these lifeless ones on the ground, but
the spirit of swift-handed helpfulness, utterly in accord
with him in thought and purpose, no words being
necessary. So this was why he had been standing in
the dark with uncovered head, rubbing his hand over
his brow—that her closeness might come through to
him! Not so weird, after all, that he should know
this, standing upon the soaked turf of the <i>maidan</i>.
Things of this kind had often happened to soldiers on
the battlefields of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>Was this what it was all about then—the separation,
the struggling—at last to become connected to her this
way, though across the world? He mustn’t study it
too closely. He had a warning that he would spoil it,
unless he kept on heartily with the work. So he continued
separating the wounded, but every little while
when his hands were free he would stop and uncover
his head to the moist warmth of the evening. Would
she come nearer and nearer through the years?...
And these were her dead and her dying, and she had
blessed the little Hindu girl with coarse black hair.
He smiled at the absurdity of his thoughts.</p>

<p>Now it was full dark and the cries of the living
women across the <i>maidan</i> were raised in agony because
they must leave the Bagh before the curfew sounded.
Hundreds were still searching. They had not found
their own, but it was close to eight o’clock and this—the
dead on the field—was what had come of breaking
Martial Law to-day. It did not matter that lives might
still be saved if the wounded could be taken out from
the dead. <i>Sarkar</i> had fired upon them to-day. <i>Sarkar</i>
would come with more death, if they disobeyed. Husbands
dragged away the women whose faces turned
back.</p>

<p>Richard Cobden stayed on. He had the sense of not
being alone. Moreover, there was much to do. There
were voices to answer. He heard cries and callings
from the windows of the houses that overlooked the
<i>maidan</i>. No English came that night—but the pariah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
dogs from all the city and outskirts. They moved like
ghouls in the shadows. There were mysteries everywhere—white
vapors from the ground. He saw and
felt the unutterable; became rich for future years in
that one night with the fruits of sadness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XLVIII<br />

<small>“INDIA’S MESSENGER”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">COBDEN walked back from the <i>maidan</i> through
the streets of Amritsar in the dawn. He did
not feel like a foreigner. That which had
happened during the night had furnished him with
what rarely comes to a white man—the Indian point
of view. He was in the Indian fabric for the moment,
at least; no longer a spectator from the West. He did
not hate England, not even the crooked finger that had
mismanaged for England. He knew something right
now that he might not be able even to remember—more
sorrow than anger.</p>

<p>As he approached the Golden Temple, near which
was the Inn, Nagar appeared in the street, and they
walked together in silence. As he tottered a little,
Nagar’s arm swung around him and Dicky said:</p>

<p>“Don’t. I’m very dirty.”</p>

<p>Now that the light was coming on, they saw people
hurrying to the Jallianwalla Bagh.</p>

<p>In the room, Dicky said:</p>

<p>“Make a lot of tea, Nagar. Sorry you won’t join
me in a little drink from the flask.”</p>

<p>A moment later, he said:</p>

<p>“I think after all, you’ll have to help me get off this
shirt. I’m a rubbed-in mess of blood and dirt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>Nagar perceived that the body of the American
trembled full-length; also that his clothing was soaked
with blood from the wounded shoulder, as well as
from stains received from handling others.</p>

<p>“... Some of them crawled about in the dark!”
Dicky was saying. “A woman sat there moaning
through the whole night. The pariahs came—I heard
them lapping, lapping. From the windows of the
houses around the Bagh came the cries of the women
who dared not disobey the curfew.... Why, that
ten minutes of firing was longer than whole years I
lived as a schoolboy, but the ten hours since dark—that
passed, Nagar, like a man walking by a house, not
a lame man.... I saw your India, oh, yes. The
gentlest-tempered crowd I ever moved through, but
something dangerous and deadly in its pain and grief.
God help us—when you wake up——”</p>

<p>Nagar helped him. Dicky bathed his neck and face
and hair copiously with one hand, and then washed the
left arm. With Nagar’s help the wound was packed
with clean lint. Dicky drank hot tea, filling his goblet
several times and shivering, though the heat of the
night was still in the room. Finally he sat down in his
bathrobe by the open window and lit a cigarette. The
sunlight had found the gold of the Temple dome.</p>

<p>“... I actually forgot myself,” Dicky repeated.
“When an American forgets himself, Nagar, you can
be sure a big show is being pulled off.... I’ve
smoked too much, talked too much. I am going to lie
down for a little—until breakfast.... Bed! Think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
of having a bed, in Amritsar. A bed with sheets....
Out there so many were lying on the ground.
Oh, I say, Nagar, where will they put them all?”</p>

<p>The Hindu’s cool, slim fingers reached over and
touched his hand. He didn’t speak, just kept his hand
still, and Dicky found it easier to stop talking, because
of that hand; easier to endure the furious forces of
activity in his brain. Finally Nagar spoke:</p>

<p>“I had to stay with the students. They wanted to
go to the <i>maidan</i>. That would not have been well, but
it was well for you to be there—to forget yourself
there through the hours. It will come forth from you
for years—not as the voice of an American, but as a
citizen of the world. You have prepared long; last
night India found you prepared, and dared to show
you something of herself. Miss Claes would be very
glad to be here with us this morning.”</p>

<p>Dicky’s mind fumbled with the idea that he had not
only come closer into the Indian heart, but into Nagar’s
as well.</p>

<p>“You might sleep a little until breakfast. I shall not
leave you until after that. You are very tired and
spent, but you will not be injured from last night.
When a man forgets himself, as you say, he is strangely
replenished.”</p>

<p>But Dicky did not sleep. They breakfasted early
and Nagar arose, saying:</p>

<p>“... In the days that you remain in Amritsar
finishing your work (for last night will mean more
and more to you as the days go on) you and I shall not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
be much together. What you see in Amritsar—you
must watch without feeling or partisanship. One cannot
tell—you may see strange things. Remember,
always remember, that you are American; that as an
American you have no enemies, and belong to the
world. In the fusion of all Europe, which America is,
to form a new type of nobility, remember that no
country has furnished a nobler ingredient—than England.
And forgive my many words, Richard, if I ask
you to remember this also: that anything which might
happen to me here in Amritsar in the days you remain,
must never make you forget that you have a message
to carry to America.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand, Nagar.”</p>

<p>“It is difficult to say. I can only repeat: Anything
which might happen to me in this city must not arouse
in you a personal or partisan effort to help me. We
must be strangers—unless I come to you alone. The
English are beside themselves; they know not what
they do. You must have no feelings about me—to
betray you. Go further into the English. Forget me—except
as a part of your own source of kindness and
strength.”</p>

<p>Nagar was gone. As Dicky conned all this, he
began to wonder if he would see his friend again. All
the days before this in Amritsar, he had been waiting
for things to get quiet so that he and Nagar might
really begin to get together.... “India’s messenger,”
he muttered, as he fell asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XLIX<br />

<small>PIDGE TRIES GRAMERCY PARK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE second part of Dicky Cobden’s letter about
Gandhi written after his three interviews in
Bombay, reached Pidge fully a fortnight after
the first. Of course, it interested her, as it could no
one else.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... From several angles I placed before Mahatma-ji,
the concept of dreamers of all countries—the
dream of the mating of the East and West, that the
New Race is to be born of this mating; that globe
means globe, and a world citizen must belong to all;
that as Goethe says, “above the nations is Humanity.”
This thing, you understand, has attracted me merely as
a concept, not with the dreamer’s fire at all. Short
work Gandhi made of the mating of the East and West.
The damsel, New India, is not ready for marriage.
She is not clean. She has not found herself, therefore
has not herself to give. (These are not his words,
but the idea.) She must become free, before she has
anything to bestow. She is just a perfumed body,
which the West has already desecrated and begun to
despise—merely an offering now, not a wife. What
Gandhi arrays himself against to-day is the fact that
India has already fallen under the lure of the West.
She has felt the fascination of his big toys, the glamour
of his mighty works. The Little Man has made me see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
that a woman who “falls for” a man, can never become
the man-maker which a wife must be, maker of her
husband as well as child. Queer, how it came to me
that way first, before I saw the man’s side of it—the
great thing you have done, pushing me back, forever
pushing me back into myself, until that day when I
shall be able to <i>stand</i>, not “fall for” you. I am learning—learning
so slowly what I bargained for that night
at the Punjabi Fireplace. “... Go back into your
house!” Gandhi cries to India. (Not his words, you
know; merely my picture of him.) “Fast and pray.
That is safe. Fast and pray and spin! Pray to the
hum of the <i>charka</i>. Forget your lover. Find yourself.
You are the East, the inner. Already you have been
lured by his brutal boyish games. You have flattered
him, but already he despises you. What does he bring
now, but a bloody carcass to your hearth, saying,
‘Arise. Gut and skin.’”... Mahatma-ji is on
the ground. Now, To-day, seeing but one step—the
next step—crying, “Go Back!” This is the most
extraordinary part to me, that his very limitations
appear to be in use!</p>
</div>

<p>In early July, Pidge made her first move since coming
to New York. The spirit had gone out of the
house in Harrow Street for her, with Miss Claes’
departure. She sent the boy-baby up into the country
and took a room at the <i>Sennacherib</i> in Gramercy Park,
a step of which Rufe Melton strongly approved:</p>

<p>“You were getting stale down there, Pan,” he said,
one night when he came to dine. “The Village is all
right for a novelty, but real New York hasn’t time for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
that sort of thing. I see you’re running Carver’s novel
in the <i>P. S.</i> What did you get in on that for? Did he
give it to you?”</p>

<p>“Rather not. It cost real money.”</p>

<p>“A hang-over from John Higgins’ desk?”</p>

<p>“No, we took it after—after——”</p>

<p>“Carver could never have slipped that over on you,
Pan,” he broke in, “if you had lived uptown. But no,
you never would listen to me, that a thing isn’t great
because it’s nasty——”</p>

<p>“You think it isn’t a successful serial?”</p>

<p>“Not a chance——”</p>

<p>There was truth in what he said. The new novel
was rapidly unreeling in generous installments, without
much gratifying noise from the readers.</p>

<p>Rufe confided that he was doing a long story, and
that Redge Walters was very much interested in it as a
serial prospect.</p>

<p>“What’s it on?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Business,” said Rufe. “Shipping—grain—iron—packing-houses.
Everybody’s panting for business
since the War.”</p>

<p>“Sounds American.”</p>

<p>“Epic of the Great Lakes, Pan. Never knew what I
was about, till now——”</p>

<p>She was thinking of Amritsar—of the first Amritsar
mail recently in from Richard Cobden, posted at
Pondicherry, French India—of <i>hathis</i> and her new
<i>mahout</i>—of British bulletins, native documents, and
Dicky’s own straight story of April 10th and 13th. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
had been difficult for Pidge not to become too excited
by all this. For the first time Dicky’s work had carried
her off her feet. That had been days ago, and she had
not altogether trusted her fiercely fresh enthusiasm,
but it didn’t subside, and at the present minute, the
epic of the Great Lakes sounded to her like a forlorn
side show. Moreover, Dicky’s Amritsar story, about
to be printed in <i>The Public Square</i>, took away most of
the disappointment in that Carver’s novel hadn’t proved
a powerful stimulus to circulation.</p>

<p>“Its capital is Chicago,” Rufe further divulged about
his book. “Funny how you have to get away from
there to see that big town. All the years I lived in
Chi—never got next to her, as I have since I came to
New York.... Yes, it’s booming along. Haven’t
been really right until just now, since I was gassed.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad, Rufe.”</p>

<p>“It’s got a <i>mahatma</i> in it,” Rufe chuckled.</p>

<p>“A what?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, Pan?”</p>

<p>“That word—from you!”</p>

<p>“You look as if you’d seen the Dweller——”</p>

<p>“The what, Rufe?”</p>

<p>He chuckled again. “Didn’t know I’ve been going
in for the occult, did you? Say Pan, there’s one fine
thing about you. I never feel as if you could be
disappointed in your Rufie.”</p>

<p>“Why is that?” She was entirely off his trend.</p>

<p>“You haven’t started to expect anything of me....
Oh, yes, had to have a <i>mahatma</i> in the story.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
It’s the new thing. Everybody’s got one since the War.
Not enough to go round.... This <i>mahatma</i> of
mine in Chi is wise to the stock exchange. It’s his tip,
you know, that the whole tale turns on. Reader never
thinks of it—until it’s pulled.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get your model?”</p>

<p>He laughed again. “Right in the family, Pan. Been
going to hear Adolphus. Say, you never did appreciate
your father. Bad habit of yours, Pan, honest to God—to
lose respect for a man just because you live with
him.”</p>

<p>Pidge was in a whirl. Her hands dropped down to
the seat of her chair on either side and gripped hard.
The world looked about as big to her as Delaware;
Amritsar and New York signaling to each other.</p>

<p>“Heard him this afternoon—in the ballroom of the
<i>Pershing</i>—swell crowd out,” Rufe pursued. “Talked
on Lytton’s <i>Zanoni</i>. I’m going to read that book.
And didn’t Adolph put it over to the damsels and dowagers!
Just what I need for my white <i>mahatma</i>.
Where does the old man get all that? It’s a wonder
you haven’t gotten in on your father’s stuff, Pan.”</p>

<p>She wanted Miss Claes as never before. This was
too much for one small person to hold. When she
really listened again, Rufe was asking to go upstairs
with her to see her room.</p>

<p>“It’s just a common room. What’s the use?”</p>

<p>“Little afraid to see me alone, eh, Pan?”</p>

<p>“Not afraid—only what’s the use?”</p>

<p>“You might see it different——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>“I might have once, Rufe——”</p>

<p>“Say, Pan——”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Does Mrs. Melton want to be free?”</p>

<p>Her hands dropped to the seat of her chair again.
She saw the new want in his eyes and something
else—the old captive thing.</p>

<p>There were two possible answers to his question, and
it took every minute of her twenty-five years, and all
that had gone before, to choose. This is what she
said:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Melton will never be free!”</p>

<p>“What—what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Ask your <i>mahatma</i>, Rufe.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">L<br />

<small>DICKY’S IDEA WORKS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PIDGE felt the hugeness of life around her at
last. Doors were being opened as never before.
She saw as clearly as if Rufe Melton had confessed
to her, that it was he who wanted to be free.
She could grant this well enough; having been forced
to it, in effect, from the beginning. He would doubtless
come again soon, making it plain that he wanted her to
agree to divorce. The point was that certain barriers
and limitations in her own life were suddenly lifted.
It was as if she had emerged from a city, to the shore
of the sea, and before her eyes was an unbroken horizon
line.</p>

<p>The abrupt extension frightened her. The story of
Amritsar now unfolding for her from the Indian
mail—in its hatelessness, in its devotion to truth and
unsentimental love for the people—unveiled for her
eyes a <i>man</i>—not Gandhi, not Nagar, but Richard
Cobden, himself. The few sentences he had inserted
in his letter about Gandhi, “—the great thing you have
done, pushing me back, forever pushing me back into
myself, until the day when I shall be able to <i>stand</i>, not
fall for you!”—in these words there was for Pidge
an invincible call.</p>

<p>She had searched the language for another expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
to convey what that little slangy verb “to fall for”
meant. It was one of her treasures. When one “fell
for” a person or thing—one couldn’t stand for the
same. One was captive, not co-worker. Here was
the difference between infatuation and romance. Dicky
had found it out. There was expressed in his letter
more than she had dreamed as possible; and this time
words thrilled her furiously, because she believed they
had become working knowledge, before it had occurred
to him to express the idea. She saw this knowledge
working out in his studies of Gandhi. He did not
“fall for” the Little Man. He did not rush into
eulogy; he sought to understand. In a word, he stood
for Gandhi. But now that Dicky was ready to stand
for her, she was ready to fall, and all her horizons were
being pushed back to give her room.</p>

<p>... She was very weary. She had not known
it before. <i>The Public Square</i> thrived. It was strong
pulsed with new life. For the first time in her experience
she sensed from the magazine’s field, following the
issue of the first Amritsar story—silence, the perfect
tribute, the instantaneous readjustment of all other
journals; then crowded mails, the answer from people
everywhere. Something about Gandhi touched hundreds
of people to the point of saying so, in a letter to
<i>The Public Square</i>.</p>

<p>Yes, she was weary. She had held grimly to the
post. She wanted to turn it over to Dicky Cobden
now.... It had been like this once before—on the
night of Somebody’s Shoulder. She had wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
give him what he wanted that night—the tiredest and
most hopeless girl in New York. Only that night it
had been—for what he had. Now it was for what he
was.</p>

<p>John Higgins lost his bearings in the city traffic. A
copy of the issue containing the first section of the
Amritsar story was in the old editor’s hand when he
fell in the street. She was with him for several hours,
until the end. He looked at her long and strangely—eyes
more “run-out” than ever. He did not seem to
hear her words, but if she remained in silence too long,
a little frown gathered on his forehead, and his hand
would pull at hers. He had waited for the big story.
Once he said:</p>

<p>“I wish Dicky would come,” and that brought
Pidge’s slow tears.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next day a solicitor called at the office and Pidge
still felt squally. She couldn’t grasp what he was
saying. She thought it had something to do with a
secret society that was going to attend an absurd matter,
known as “obsequies.” She was deluged in words.</p>

<p>“... Be perfectly calm, Mrs. Melton,” the
solicitor said at last. “This isn’t exactly bad news, but
I’ve known lasting injury from the one, as well as the
other——”</p>

<p>“Please—what are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Your legacy——”</p>

<p>“My—I don’t——”</p>

<p>“From the late John Higgins——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>“But it was only last night!”</p>

<p>“The late John Higgins, nevertheless. The demise——”</p>

<p>“And what about it?”</p>

<p>“That he has left you—this paper in my hand
being the memorandum—his interest in <i>The Public
Square</i>——”</p>

<p>“Me——”</p>

<p>“A half-interest in the ownership, to be exact——”</p>

<p>Pidge glanced around the room. The man was
sitting. The first and terrible obstacle of life was to
remove him, or escape from him.</p>

<p>“What have I to do?”</p>

<p>“Just sign——”</p>

<p>But he was still sitting, after she had signed. He
wanted to be sociable.... She was on the car going
home. She hopped off at Eighth Street, and was
turned into Harrow, before she realized that she didn’t
live there any more but in Gramercy Park....
Curving Harrow Street was quiet and calling. She
went in to the curve and stood before the old green
front. A sign on the door announced “Rooms, Permanent
and Transient.”... “What kind of rooms
are transient rooms?” she thought. The curb and
doorstep thronged with memories. “Oh, Dicky, it’s
too much,” she whispered at last. “Come soon, and
prop me up!”</p>

<small>“WE LOOK UPON WOMEN AS SACRED”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>“DO you people want peace or war? If you
wish for war the Government is prepared
for it, and if you want peace, then obey my
orders and open all your shops; else, I will shoot. For
me the battlefield of France or Amritsar is the same.
I am a military man and I will go straight. Neither
shall I move to the right, nor to the left. Speak up,
if you want war. In case there is to be peace, my order
is to open all shops at once. Obey orders. I do not
wish to have anything else. I have served in the military
for over thirty years. I understand the Indian
sepoy and the Sikh people very well. You must inform
me of the budmashes. I will shoot them. Obey my
orders and open shops. Speak up if you want war.”</i></p>

<p>General Fyatt was talking to a large company of
Amritsar’s native representatives, lawyers, merchants,
doctors, in the <i>kotwali</i>, the day after the massacre.</p>

<p>The Deputy Commissioner added: “You have committed
a bad act in killing the English. The revenge
will be taken upon you and upon your children.”</p>

<p>The large company of natives listened. Not one
spoke of the Jallianwalla Bagh, or of the dead which
still lay there. Richard Cobden reasoned with himself;
neither did he speak. Out of all the burn of feelings
and the great waste of ineffectual thoughts, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
dawning upon him that in their own good time, the
dead of Amritsar’s public square would speak for
themselves.</p>

<p>In the days that followed Dicky worked quietly,
worked from the standpoint of the English almost
entirely. He “exposed” himself like a film to the
aftermath of the tragedy. He went after facts and
statements. It was never to be ascertained, the number
of killed and injured. The English granted about
three hundred dead; the natives claimed five times that,
even more. He was much at Headquarters; and confined
himself altogether to the Civil Lines. Through
Lala Relu Ram, he received certain secret reports from
the native point of view, and guarded these little tissues
assiduously. A cigarette case contained them all.</p>

<p>He went each day to the Crawling Lane, as one
doing a city beat for a newspaper would call at city
hall or recorders’ court. This was the place where Miss
Sherwood was assaulted by the natives, on the 10th.
It was narrow and thickly populated, with double-story
buildings on either side, and numerous blind alleys
shooting out of the lane.</p>

<p>The crawling order remained in force for eight
days. Although General Fyatt called it “going on all
fours,” and it had been called the “hand and knee
order” by the press, the process consisted in the persons
lying flat on their bellies and crawling like reptiles.
Any lifting of the knees or bending thereof brought
the rifle butts of the soldiers and police on the native
backs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>“But, General,” Dicky said cheerfully, “people are
forced to crawl through there or go without food and
medicine—people who have never seen Miss Sherwood,
much less taken part in the assault.”</p>

<p>“She was beaten,” General Fyatt declared. “We
look upon women as sacred.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the American.</p>

<p>In the Crawling Lane and elsewhere were erected
<i>tikitis</i> for flogging. These were triangles of wood,
upon which the hands could be suspended and tied. A
general order was issued for all the native population
of Amritsar, a city of one hundred and sixty thousand,
to <i>salam</i> to English in the streets. Those who did not
<i>salam</i> were arrested, often flogged. Many of the people
were so terrified, that they dared not sit down
anywhere outside of their own houses, lest one of the
English appear suddenly and not find them standing
and in position to <i>salam</i>.</p>

<p>During the late days of April, Richard Cobden did
not see Nagar, though occasional brief messages
reached him from his friend through the students.
One of these was a suggestion, which Dicky followed,
to send off whatever mail he had ready, in care of one
of the young men who was leaving for Pondicherry,
French India. Finally there was the episode of the
tennis court, in the Civil Lines. Dicky drew up to the
crowd.</p>

<p>A set of doubles or singles was not in progress.
This was a game of triangle—a <i>tikiti</i> in the center of
the court; a naked native strung up and being whipped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
Dicky had seen about enough of this, and was ready
to turn back, when something of the carriage of the
native’s head arrested his eye, and started a peculiar
sinking in his heart.</p>

<p>The bare back was toward him, but the face turned
sidewise revealed the profile of Nagar. His hands
were strapped high toward the top of the great frame
formed in the shape of the letter A. Nagar had been
stripped to the loincloth, his head bare, his white robes
and turban cloth flung upon the turf. The stripes were
being put on by one of the native police. The whip
was a rigid canelike affair, but longer than a walking-stick.
A detachment of native soldiers was drawn up
on one side, police on the other. Two young officers
of the military, one of whom Dicky knew, were in
charge of the affair.</p>

<p>Dicky had halted, hand to mouth. Each stroke
blinded his eyes; his body became, for an instant after
it, like a house in flames with every curtain tightly
drawn. Then he would see the sunlight before the
next stroke, and the naked man with bleeding back.
He had direct need to turn his back upon this thing—the
old nausea. It never occurred to him that this was
his own great test, greater than Nagar’s, for such
tests of the human heart do not come announced; but
out of all past experience, one thing stood in the midst
of a rocking universe—that if he did anything in this
red blindness, he would do worse than nothing.</p>

<p>He walked away, his elbows jerking up as another
stroke fell. The thing that saved him was already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
accomplished. The turning of his back was all that
was required, apparently, since in this instant he got a
life and death grip on the word <i>Messenger</i>. Was he
Nagar’s friend or India’s messenger?</p>

<p>Then he knew just one furious smearing doubt.
What of human loyalty—to stand by and allow this
thing to go on? He was answered in his mind from
Nagar’s own words, “Mahatma-ji’s ideal isn’t human,
Richard. It is of the Soul.” Action of a foreigner in
behalf of a native would only intensify the English
fears and the native’s plight. To rush in was John
Higgins’ code. Evidently there was another.</p>

<p>He walked around to meet Nagar face to face. Ten
feet away, he stood until Nagar’s eyes came up to his.
Had Nagar’s hand been free to lift and command
<i>Silence</i>, his lips free to speak, the word could not have
been more fiercely impressed. Indeed, the word <i>Silence</i>
seemed to have been shot into the American’s consciousness.</p>

<p>A blow fell. Nagar’s eyes closed; his lips stretched
out as if struck by an invisible hand. Then under the
trailing eyelids, Dicky saw a look of inexpressible
gratitude and relief—the barest beginning of a smile.
Nagar had found him fit to trust. It was another
moment of real life, that moment of the look, another
instant of essential recognition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Oh, I say, Cobden—have you seen a ghost?”</p>

<p>It was Langoyer, one of the young English officers,
who spoke. He was leaning upon his cane, to flick a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
cigarette stub off the court with his boot. Langoyer
paid no attention to the flogging. The men attended
to that, you know. One had to stand by—as one would
wait for his horse to drink.</p>

<p>Dicky was now being lashed to the quick himself.
He had seen clearly—but a sort of hideous night had
settled upon him again. He had to watch his temper.</p>

<p>“How many does this man get, Langoyer?” he
managed to ask.</p>

<p>“Thirty.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“He knows more of the sedition of Kitchlew and
Satyapal than he’ll tell.”</p>

<p>The figure had gone limp on the triangle.</p>

<p>“Fainted,” gasped Richard Cobden.</p>

<p>The whipping stopped. A tin bucket of water was
brought and dashed upon Nagar’s face and shoulders.
A moan came from him because he was not quite
conscious. Then the knees drew up and his feet felt
for the ground.</p>

<p>The lieutenant stepped forward taking Nagar’s ear
in his right hand and calling aloud:</p>

<p>“Will you tell the truth now of Kitchlew’s plot
against Government?”</p>

<p>Nagar looked at him without hatred. He tried to
speak twice before the words came:</p>

<p>“I have already told the truth——”</p>

<p>“How many stripes have been given?” Langoyer
asked.</p>

<p>“Twenty-six.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>“Finish the thirty, then take him to <i>kotwali</i>. A few
days more will make him tell all right.”</p>

<p>The American remained. One—two—three—four.</p>

<p>The hands were unstrapped. The robe was cast
about the shoulders. Nagar could stand. Dicky left
the officers and followed his friend and the native
policemen to the station, feeling like a pariah’s whelp.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">LII<br />

<small>THE OLD FACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DICKY reflected that there were two ways of
looking at a person or a thing, a fact proven
several times in his experience. There had
been a moment in the presence of Gandhi, after many
minutes of talk, when the face, that had been dull and
unattractive as a camel driver’s, had suddenly appeared
to him with memorable, essential significance. It had
been so with Miss Claes: also the moment when he
had really seen Pidge, as they stood together on the
Palisades of Santa Monica. Recently he had caught
an immortal something in the look from Nagar on the
rack.</p>

<p>He did not see Nagar again in Amritsar, but up to
mid-May the students reported that his friend was still
imprisoned. The sound of those falling strokes was
slow to die out of the corridors of Dicky’s memory.
They awoke him in the night. It was far easier, however,
to recall the splendor of gameness in the way
Nagar had taken his beating. This satisfied every
American instinct; and even above this, was the mystery
of compassion for the English, in Nagar’s face.
Here was a man on a tennis court in a remote Punjabi
town, hardly heard-of in this war-racked world, plainly
putting over the thing he had marveled at, as a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
boy in Sunday school: “Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do.”</p>

<p>Apparently the same majestic composure. Life held
many things; yet Richard Cobden couldn’t be sure altogether,
that he had not outraged the spirit of friendship
in failing to register his protest of word and deed.
Of course, the consequences might have been disastrous,
but, at least, a certain man-to-man loyalty would
have been satisfied.</p>

<p>If further tortures were inflicted upon Nagar, Dicky
was not informed. The Amritsar story was no longer
on the outside; it was in Richard Cobden’s brain and
heart. He wrote some of it and his letters were forwarded,
but still he conned and brooded. Having held
still through the whipping of Nagar, he found it easier
to stand in the midst of current events without losing
his head, or letting emotion or opinion have right of
way.</p>

<p>Late in May, a student brought word that Nagar
was free and had gone south. This was all that Dicky
had been waiting for. Crawling, salaming, flogging,
imprisonment and forced testimony had long since become
to him a full and bitter cup. At the station, as
he waited for his train, a student, edging near, managed
to whisper two words:</p>

<p>“<i>Ashrama</i>, Ahmedabad.”</p>

<p>The American’s head bowed slightly. He had
meant to go to Ahmedabad anyway.</p>

<p>He was not met at the station there, but a servant at
the <i>Entresden</i> told him to go at once to the <i>Ashrama</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
He obeyed, and found himself listening for the voice
of Mahatma-ji, as he entered, but his eyes searched
the shadows of the hall for Nagar, a kind of breathless
pain about it all.</p>

<p>As the door of an inner room opened, at last, and the
native who conducted him drew back, Dicky saw a
woman standing in the dimness. Her face, turned
toward him, was a mere blur of darkness, but there was
a leap toward her in Richard Cobden’s breast. Then
he stood before her, in a daze of joy, one hand in hers,
one upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>“It happened very quickly in New York,” she told
him. “A letter saying that I was coming could hardly
have reached you before the steamer that brought
me——”</p>

<p>“But, Miss Claes—New York! What are we to
do—no Harrow Street?”</p>

<p>“You will know what to do,” she said. “And about
the things that were in your rooms. I had them carefully
boxed and sent to your mother, who was well
when I left. Also your aunt and sister.”</p>

<p>He took from his pocket the old dark key to the
“parlor” door. She bent and touched it.</p>

<p>“Keep it, Richard,” she said, “until I send you another.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“And Nagar——” he began at length.</p>

<p>“He is here.”</p>

<p>“And well? I could get so little word.”</p>

<p>“Nagar has been hurt, but is healing. Look——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>Dicky turned to find his friend standing behind them
at the door. He had felt a presence there, but thought
it was the native who had brought him. Nagar’s eyes
looked very large in the wasted face.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, all is well with me,” he said. “I have been
sorry to leave you so much alone in the north....
Yes,” he added, “it was harder for you than for me—the
test that day on the tennis court. You were brave,
my friend. I knew all was well—when the instant
passed and you remained silent.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean—all was well?”</p>

<p>“I knew that the message of India would get to
America—since you did not spoil it by defending me.”</p>

<p>Nagar turned to Miss Claes, adding:</p>

<p>“I saw the fury and fright rise in his eyes, and all
the impulses of ethics of the West—then silence over
all. It was as if we were cemented——”</p>

<p>Dicky remembered that last word afterward.</p>

<p>As he moved about and talked, he was vaguely conscious
of watching the other two together. It was as
if Pidge would want to hear of every gesture and detail.
Miss Claes was less Indian here than in Harrow
Street. There he had thought of her as belonging to
the East; here she seemed of the West. Something of
the composure he had noted on the tennis court had
come to stay in Nagar’s eyes. As moments passed,
Dicky knew that they contained deep vitalities of meaning
that would appear in coming days.</p>

<p>It was as if his limitations were being stretched, but
by consummate hands. There was repeatedly brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
to him, from them, something that he refused to hear
or dwell with: that he had done well, that he was
deeply approved of in their sight; that there was much
more to take place between them as a group, even
though they were to stay in Asia, and he was leaving
for The States.... Then all faces turned, and in the
doorway stood the Little Man.</p>

<p>No one spoke, but to Richard Cobden it was one
moment of his life that he thought of as religious.
Mahatma-ji came in between them, and Dicky felt the
old urge somehow to help with his hands; the sense,
too, of all India thronging, whispering around them.
For a moment the four had been standing in silence,
when they heard the <i>sweep</i> of bare slow feet in the hall,
and now an old dark face was in the doorway, a smile
serene as nothing else on earth but the Hills themselves—a
dark wrinkled old face, and she came forward and
stood very low and little in the midst of them—Gandhi’s
comrade.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In San Francisco, waiting for the departure of his
train east, a card was sent up to Cobden’s hotel room.
It was from Chris Heidt, the managing editor of his
former newspaper connection.</p>

<p>“Hello, Cobden. Just noticed you were off ship.
What did you bring back?”</p>

<p>Dicky reflected. “The story of Amritsar,” he said
finally.</p>

<p>“Amritsar, what’s that?”</p>

<p>“The first big story I ever ran across. I feel like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
one of Job’s servants, who said he alone remained to
make a report.”</p>

<p>Mr. Heidt had been much on trains during the past
few days, and had missed the fact, so far, that <i>The
Public Square</i> had begun to publish the story.</p>

<p>“Not going to bury it in a weekly, are you?”</p>

<p>“I have much more than <i>The Public Square</i> could
use in months. It really should get out into the broad
market. The end of one world and the birth of another
took place that Sunday in Amritsar—all in miniature,
you understand——”</p>

<p>He spoke of Gandhi, whose name had scarcely been
heard at this time in America, and touched upon the
story of <i>maidan</i>.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Mr. Heidt. “Sure, it’s a big yarn, but
months ago. No way to substantiate it. You’re a little
out of perspective, Cobden, seeing it all first hand
that way.”</p>

<p>“I can substantiate it,” Dicky said queerly.</p>

<p>“I know, but the whole story’s a trouble-maker. Far
as I can make out, this Gandhi is a sort of sanctimonious
Lenine, and we’re not promoting any kind of
Lenines just now. Red roughhouses all over the world,
but we’re not advertising the fact. The best newspaper
interests here and in England are letting that sort of
thing die down. Everybody’s healthily intent on getting
back to business right now. Make a corking fiction
setting—your Amritsar—series of short stories
that would do no harm.”</p>

<p>Thus Richard had his American perspective restored.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">LIII<br />

<small>THE WHITE LIGHT AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DICKY was considerably subdued. India had
permitted his ideas to romp at large. He had
forgotten that, home again, these ideas must
be brought down to an orderly trudge. America, as a
whole, seemed one-pointedly trying to get back to work
after the War, calling all protestors untimely and in
bad taste. Dicky thought out the situation minutely
and severely during the three full travel days to Chicago.
At the end of each day he was somewhat exhausted
from the big bonfires that had taken place
within him—piles of rubbish, glamour and the like.</p>

<p>In Chicago he procured two numbers of <i>The Public
Square</i> preceding the current issue, and before his eyes
was the manner in which Pidge had “sprung” the
Amritsar story. He felt the magic of her working
with him in an altogether new way. The latest number
confessed, not without grace, that the story of Gandhi
and Amritsar had aroused the more open-minded element
of the American public, as nothing else since the
War; but thanks to Chris Heidt, the returning correspondent
watched the rising tide of public interest in
his work, as a spectator unexpectant, instead of a performer
who fancies he has the world by the tail. It
dawned on him, however, that Chris Heidt hadn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
known quite all that was going on in America under
the homely thunders of trade.</p>

<p>He reached New York in the early evening and went
to Fiftieth Street at once. There he had dinner, and
an hour of talk, before he rang up Mrs. Melton at the
<i>Sennacherib</i>.</p>

<p>“Is this Mr. Cobden?” a voice asked presently.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Melton left word for you to go to 54 Harrow
Street—to the parlor on the second floor, the card
says.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cobden didn’t take out his own car that night.
Perhaps he didn’t feel as if he could keep his mind on
getting himself downtown. He sat back in the cushions
of his mother’s limousine; and Conrad, whose
career as Cobden coachman had changed to Cobden
chauffeur nearly twenty years ago, handled the big box
like a hearse.</p>

<p>“Sit tight, Dicky,” he breathed, and never once urged
Conrad forward. In fact, Dicky didn’t speak, until it
became necessary to show the way a little, for Harrow
Street is tricky to find from Washington Square.</p>

<p>“Don’t wait—yes, you’d better wait, Conrad,” he
called, crossing the walk to the door.</p>

<p>The outer door was unlatched. He hurried up one
flight. The same curtain, the white light.</p>

<p>“Pidge——”</p>

<p>She came forth from the inner room. She halted a
few feet from him, and he saw her searching, imploring
look. His shoulders straightened, his hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
dropped to his side. The finer elements of his understanding
sensed the great need of a woman, which his
brain did not actually register. To answer her need
in action, however, was instantly more dominant within
him than his thirst for herself.</p>

<p>She came a step nearer. Light was filling her eyes—the
shining of an almost incredible hope.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dicky, you can! I believe you can!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>She was nearer.</p>

<p>“And I can come and rest—a little?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Pidge——”</p>

<p>“I want to rest so badly, you know.”</p>

<p>She had come to him under the light.</p>

<p>“... And, oh, since I knew you were coming, everything
has been different. I haven’t been <i>me</i> at all!
I’ve never played—and now everything—all work—is
silly, unimportant. Dicky, everything seems to be
done!”</p>

<p>“I’m on the job, Pidge; you can play——”</p>

<p>“Until I find myself—you—you will stand for two?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Pidge.”</p>

<p>“All my things, your things, Dicky—so I can rush
away and breathe?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m here for.”</p>

<p>“Rufe Melton and my father and the desk—all
yours?”</p>

<p>“And the baby, too, Pidge.”</p>

<p>“Dicky—Dicky—don’t dare to look! I’m going to
cry!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“... Since your telegram from San Francisco—it
seemed I could hardly stay alive! Oh, it’s so good to
rest!”</p>

<p>“Not a hurry in the world!”</p>

<p>“Everything seemed done—and no place for me!...
Rufe and a rich girl uptown—oh, they’re in full
blossom and he wants to be free! My father caught
on in New York—no need now for me. <i>The Public
Square</i> on the high road at last; your Amritsar story
capturing the whole field; nothing to do but to feed the
presses more and more; Miss Claes gone, and the
Legacy—oh, Dicky, I saw your hand back of that! I
couldn’t miss it. It touched me—touched me——”</p>

<p>“It was his idea first, Pidge. All I had to do was to
help him carry it out.”</p>

<p>“All happened at once—all the strains lifted—no one
depending—no one needing me!... I’ve been dying
to be a woman just once. I’ve never dared—never had
time. It’s so terrible to feel like a woman and not be
able——”</p>

<p>“Why not now, Pidge?”</p>

<p>“Don’t think, Dicky! I’m just resting a little. We
must work together a lot. We must clear our heads
with stacks of work—and then maybe we’ll know if
we can play.... Fanny Gallup did that for me, and
Rufe Melton is as much a baby as his infant. Other
girl, or not—Rufe will always need—us!”</p>

<p>“Pidge, listen! I couldn’t stand any more than that
now. To have you say that—<i>us</i>! To have the work
with you—to have earned that—to have your faith;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
that you dare come this close—to have years to make
the big moments we have known apart, come true together—I
couldn’t stand more, right now; that’s the
fact of it—quite!”</p>

<p>She stepped back from him looking strangely into
his face again.</p>

<p>“Dicky!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“The boy has come back to your face—that you lost
in Africa—but the new and lasting Boy!”</p>

<p>He laughed and looked around the room. It was
furnished, but barely, the “parlor” having reverted to
a sleeping room.</p>

<p>“But how did it happen—that we should come here,
Pidge?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t let you come to Gramercy Park. I remembered
that you waited to see me here after Africa,
not at the office. I came down this way—the afternoon
of the Legacy and saw the sign, ‘Rooms, Permanent
and Transient.’... I’m better now. It’s been hours,
hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>He thought of Conrad, whom he had told to wait.</p>

<p>“... This room’s all paid for,” she whispered. “I
mean we don’t have to stop to speak to anybody—only
walk out.”</p>

<p>Their eyes held.</p>

<p>“Dicky!”</p>

<p>“Yes——”</p>

<p>“Let’s go—now.”</p>

<p>“I’m—I’m ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>“Dear Dicky, the years have done so much for you!
The blur, the maze has gone out from between us.
It’s so much more wonderful, isn’t it, than that other
night here, when I almost, almost——?”</p>

<p>He waited for her to reach the hall curtains, before
he turned off the light. In the dimness of the hall, he
heard her low, slow tone:</p>

<p>“Fanny’s room was back—at the far end on this
floor——”</p>

<p>“... I remember once, Pidge, I went up the next
flight and knocked at the door of your little back
room——”</p>

<p>“That’s gone now,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Gone?”</p>

<p>“My two books that were written there—and all the
rest! I can tell you everything now—and of the book
that is still to be written—our story, Dicky.”</p>

<p>“A continued story,” he said.</p>

<p>They went down into the street, into the car.</p>

By EDITH WHARTON</p>

<p>“I can think of no American novel, written within
the last few years, and dealing with contemporary life,
